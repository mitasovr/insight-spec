-- Gold views for Insight dashboards.
-- Builds on bronze_* tables to provide columns expected by FE rawTypes.
-- MVP: single tenant, no insight_tenant_id filtering.
--
-- Prerequisites:
--   - Database `insight` exists
--   - Bronze databases: bronze_bamboohr, bronze_jira, bronze_m365, bronze_zoom
--   - Tables: staging.m365__collab_email_activity, staging.m365__collab_meeting_activity, etc.
