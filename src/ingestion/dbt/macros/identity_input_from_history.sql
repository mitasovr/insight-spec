{% macro identity_input_from_history(
    fields_history_ref,
    source_type,
    identity_fields,
    deactivation_condition
) %}
{#
  Generates identity.input rows from a fields_history model.
  Produces UPSERT rows for identity-relevant field changes, and DELETE rows
  for all identity fields when a deactivation condition is met.

  Designed for incremental models: when is_incremental() is true, only
  processes fields_history rows newer than the last observed_at in the target.

  Args:
    fields_history_ref:     ref() to the fields_history model
    source_type:            source system name (e.g., 'bamboohr', 'zoom')
    identity_fields:        list of dicts with keys:
                              - field: source field name in fields_history (e.g., 'workEmail')
                              - field_type: identity field type (e.g., 'email')
                              - field_path: fully-qualified field path
                                (e.g., 'bronze_bamboohr.employees.workEmail')
    deactivation_condition: SQL expression evaluated against fields_history row
                            that returns true when the entity is deactivated.
                            Available columns: entity_id, tenant_id, source_id,
                            field_name, old_value, new_value, updated_at.
                            Example: "field_name = 'status' AND new_value = 'Inactive'"

  Output columns (match identity.input schema):
    insight_tenant_id, source_type, source_id, profile_id,
    field_type, field_value, field_path, operation, observed_at, _synced_at, _version
