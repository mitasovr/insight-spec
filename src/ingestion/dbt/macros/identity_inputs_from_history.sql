{% macro identity_inputs_from_history(
    fields_history_ref,
    source_type,
    identity_fields,
    deactivation_condition
) %}
{#
  Generates identity_inputs rows from a fields_history model.
  Produces UPSERT rows for identity-relevant field changes, and DELETE rows
  for all identity fields when a deactivation condition is met.

  In addition, every activity in history yields a `value_type='id'`
  observation carrying `value = entity_id` (= source_account_id); this
  is the ADR-0002 canonical binding row, emitted by the macro so every
  connector contributes it uniformly without repeating boilerplate.

  Designed for incremental models: when is_incremental() is true, only
  processes fields_history rows newer than the last _synced_at in the target.

  Args:
    fields_history_ref:     ref() to the fields_history model
    source_type:            insight_source_type value (e.g., 'bamboohr', 'zoom')
    identity_fields:        list of dicts with keys:
                              - field: source field name in fields_history (e.g., 'workEmail')
                              - value_type: persons value_type (e.g., 'email',
                                'employee_id', 'display_name'). The implicit
                                `value_type='id'` row is emitted in addition to
                                whatever is listed here — do not repeat it.
                              - value_field_name: fully-qualified field path
                                (e.g., 'bronze_bamboohr.employees.workEmail')
    deactivation_condition: SQL expression evaluated against fields_history row
                            that returns true when the entity is deactivated.
                            Available columns: entity_id, tenant_id, source_id,
                            field_name, old_value, new_value, updated_at.
                            Example: "field_name = 'status' AND new_value = 'Inactive'"

  Output columns (match identity_inputs schema):
    unique_key, insight_tenant_id, insight_source_id, insight_source_type,
    source_account_id, value_type, value, value_field_name, operation_type,
    _synced_at, _version

  unique_key is `{tenant}-{source_type}-{source_account_id}-{value_type}-{operation}-{updated_at_ms}`
  — uniquely identifies one observation event. RMT(_version) deduplicates true
  duplicates (same observation re-emitted) on background merge.
