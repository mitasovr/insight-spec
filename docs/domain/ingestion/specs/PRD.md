## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

The Ingestion Layer provides the end-to-end data pipeline from external source APIs to unified Silver step 1 tables. It replaces the previously designed custom Orchestrator ([Orchestrator PRD](../../../components/orchestrator/specs/PRD.md)) and custom Connector Framework ([Connector Framework PRD](../../connector/specs/PRD.md)) with an industry-standard stack: Airbyte for data extraction, Argo Workflows for orchestration, and dbt-clickhouse for Bronze-to-Silver transformations. Everything runs in Kubernetes (Kind for local development).

### 1.2 Background / Problem Statement

The previous approach relied on a custom stdout JSON protocol for connectors, a custom runner for execution, and a custom orchestrator for scheduling. While architecturally sound, this approach required significant engineering investment to build and maintain. The ingestion layer adopts proven open-source tools — Airbyte provides 300+ pre-built connectors and a declarative connector builder, Argo Workflows provides Kubernetes-native DAG orchestration, and dbt provides battle-tested SQL transformation framework. Connections are managed via Airbyte API (see `apply-connections.sh`).

### 1.3 Goals (Business Outcomes)

- Reduce new connector development time: hours for nocode (declarative YAML), days for CDK (Python)
- Leverage Airbyte's existing connector ecosystem for common data sources
- Simplify orchestration with Kubernetes-native DAG workflows (Argo Workflows)
- Maintain workspace-level data isolation (`tenant_id` in every record)
- Enable self-contained Insight Connector packages (Airbyte manifest + dbt models + descriptor + credential template)
- Manage connections as code via Airbyte API and tenant YAML configs

- Local development: Kind K8s cluster for full-stack debugging (Airbyte + Argo Workflows + ClickHouse + dbt)
- Ultra-light development: Nocode connector Docker images run directly without Airbyte platform (see [Airbyte Connector DESIGN](../../connector/specs/DESIGN.md))
- ClickHouse cluster with shard-local tables and ReplacingMergeTree engine
- MariaDB as alternative destination for specific use cases (described separately)

### 3.2 Expected Scale

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Connector Execution

#### Airbyte Data Extraction

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-ing-airbyte-extract`

The system **MUST** extract data from external source APIs via Airbyte connectors and write raw records to ClickHouse Bronze tables.

**Rationale**: Airbyte provides the extraction runtime, connection management, and protocol handling — eliminates the need for a custom connector runtime.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-airbyte`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-source-api`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-clickhouse`

#### Nocode Connector Support

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-ing-nocode-connector`

The system **MUST** support connectors defined as Airbyte declarative YAML manifests (nocode). Manifests **MUST** be stored in the connector package directory and registered with Airbyte via its API.

**Rationale**: Nocode connectors reduce development time from days to hours for standard REST/GraphQL APIs.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-connector-author`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-airbyte`

#### CDK Connector Support

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-ing-cdk-connector`

The system **MUST** support connectors built with Airbyte's Python CDK for sources that require complex authentication, multi-step extraction, or custom transformation logic.

**Rationale**: Some sources cannot be handled by declarative manifests alone.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-connector-author`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-airbyte`

#### Tenant ID Injection

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-ing-tenant-id`

Every connector **MUST** accept `tenant_id` as a configuration parameter and include it as a field in every emitted record. For nocode connectors, this **MUST** be implemented via the `AddFields` transformation in the declarative manifest. For CDK connectors, this **MUST** be implemented in the `parse_response()` method.

**Rationale**: Workspace-level data isolation is a platform invariant — all downstream layers (Silver, Gold) depend on `tenant_id` being present in every record.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-connector-author`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-workspace-admin`

#### Incremental Sync

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-ing-incremental-sync`

Connectors **MUST** support incremental extraction using Airbyte's cursor-based sync. State **MUST** be persisted between runs to avoid full re-extraction.

**Rationale**: Full extraction is prohibitively slow and resource-intensive for large data sources.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-airbyte`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-source-api`

### 5.2 Orchestration

#### Pipeline Scheduling

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-ing-kestra-scheduling`

Argo Workflows **MUST** schedule ingestion pipelines via CronWorkflows with configurable cron expressions. Each pipeline **MUST** define the complete extract-transform cycle for one or more connectors. Schedules are declared in connector `descriptor.yaml`.

**Rationale**: Automated scheduling is essential for continuous data freshness.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-argo`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-platform-engineer`

#### Task Dependency Management

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-ing-kestra-dependency`

Argo Workflows **MUST** enforce task ordering via DAG templates: Airbyte sync **MUST** complete successfully before dbt transformation begins. Multiple independent syncs **MAY** run in parallel.

**Rationale**: dbt models read from Bronze tables — they must contain fresh data before transformation runs.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-argo`

#### Retry on Failure

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-ing-kestra-retry`

Argo Workflows **SHOULD** retry failed tasks (Airbyte sync or dbt run) with configurable retry count and backoff strategy via `retryStrategy`.

**Rationale**: Transient API failures and network issues are common in data extraction.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-argo`

### 5.3 Bronze Layer

#### Bronze Storage in ClickHouse

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-ing-bronze-storage`

Raw extracted data **MUST** be stored in ClickHouse Bronze tables. Table names **MUST** match Airbyte stream names directly (no source prefix). Tables are created in a per-tenant database namespace (e.g., `bronze_{tenant_id}`). Tables **MUST** use `ReplacingMergeTree` engine with epoch millisecond versioning.

**Rationale**: Stream-name-based table naming enables automated discovery; ReplacingMergeTree provides idempotent upserts.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-clickhouse`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-airbyte`

#### Source-Native Schema Preservation

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-ing-bronze-schema-native`

Bronze tables **MUST** preserve the source-native schema and field names. No transformations **MUST** occur at the Bronze layer beyond what Airbyte's destination connector applies (type mapping, column naming).

**Rationale**: Bronze is the raw audit layer — transformations happen in dbt.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-airbyte`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-clickhouse`

#### ClickHouse as Primary Destination

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-ing-clickhouse-destination`

Airbyte **MUST** use ClickHouse as the primary destination for all connector syncs. Shard-local table placement **MUST** be supported.

**Rationale**: ClickHouse is the platform's analytical storage engine.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-airbyte`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-clickhouse`

### 5.4 Silver Step 1 Transformations

#### dbt Bronze-to-Silver Transformations

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-ing-dbt-bronze-to-silver`

dbt models **MUST** transform Bronze tables into Silver step 1 unified tables (`class_{domain}`). Each connector package **MUST** include dbt models (e.g., `dbt/to_git.sql`, `dbt/to_collaboration.sql`) for its Silver targets.

**Rationale**: Silver tables provide the unified schema that downstream analytics and identity resolution depend on.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-dbt`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-connector-author`

#### dbt-clickhouse Adapter

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-ing-dbt-clickhouse`

dbt transformations **MUST** use the `dbt-clickhouse` adapter to execute against the ClickHouse cluster.

**Rationale**: All data resides in ClickHouse — the adapter must match the storage engine.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-dbt`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-clickhouse`

#### Unified Silver Schema

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-ing-silver-unified-schema`

Silver tables **MUST** follow the established unified schemas (`class_commits`, `class_task_tracker_activities`, `class_comms_events`, `class_people`, etc.). dbt models **MUST** map source-specific fields to the unified schema. `tenant_id` **MUST** be preserved in all Silver tables.

**Rationale**: Cross-source analytics require a common schema.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-dbt`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-connector-author`

### 5.5 Infrastructure Management

#### Connection Management via API

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-ing-terraform-connections`

Airbyte connections (source + destination + configured catalog) **MUST** be managed via `apply-connections.sh` which calls the Airbyte API directly. Connection configurations **MUST** be defined in tenant YAML files (`connections/{tenant}.yaml`) and connector descriptors (`descriptor.yaml`). Credentials **MUST NOT** be committed to version control.

**Rationale**: Configuration as code prevents drift and enables reproducible deployments. Direct API calls avoid Terraform provider version compatibility issues.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-toolbox`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-platform-engineer`

#### Custom Connector Registration via API

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-ing-airbyte-api-custom`

Custom connectors (nocode manifests and CDK Docker images) **MUST** be registered with Airbyte via `upload-manifests.sh` which calls the Airbyte API.

**Rationale**: Connector definitions are dynamic and tightly coupled to the connector package lifecycle.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-airbyte`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-platform-engineer`

### 5.6 Connector Packaging

#### Self-Contained Connector Packages

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-ing-package-structure`

Each connector **MUST** be packaged as a directory at `/src/ingestion/connectors/{connector_class}/{source_name}/` containing: (1) connector definition (`connector.yaml` for nocode or `src/` for CDK code), (2) dbt models in `dbt/` (e.g., `dbt/to_git.sql`, `dbt/to_collaboration.sql`, `dbt/to_identity_resolution.sql`) for Bronze-to-Silver transformations, (3) a `descriptor.yaml` declaring the package name, Silver targets, and stream definitions.

**Rationale**: Self-contained packages enable independent development, testing, and deployment of connectors with their transformations.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-connector-author`

#### Monorepo Package Storage

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-ing-package-monorepo`

All connector packages **MUST** reside in the project monorepo. No external package registry is required.

**Rationale**: Simplifies dependency management and ensures all packages are version-controlled together.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-connector-author`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-platform-engineer`

### 5.7 Security

#### Secret Management

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-ing-secret-management`

Credentials (API keys, OAuth tokens, client secrets) **MUST** be stored in gitignored tenant YAML files (`connections/{tenant}.yaml`) or an external secret manager (Kubernetes Secrets, Vault). Credentials **MUST NOT** be stored in connector manifests or version control. Each connector provides a `credentials.yaml.example` template documenting required fields.

**Rationale**: Credential leakage is a critical security risk.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-platform-engineer`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-workspace-admin`

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1 NFR Inclusions

#### Idempotent Extraction

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-nfr-ing-idempotency`

Re-running an Airbyte sync for the same time range **MUST** produce the same result in Bronze tables. ClickHouse `ReplacingMergeTree` with version column **MUST** handle duplicate records.

**Threshold**: Zero duplicate records after sync re-run.

**Verification**: Run same sync twice; verify record count and content are identical after `OPTIMIZE TABLE FINAL`.

#### Error Isolation

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-nfr-ing-error-isolation`

A failure in one connector sync **MUST NOT** affect other connector syncs or dbt transformations for unrelated connectors.

**Threshold**: Zero cross-connector failure propagation.

**Verification**: Fail one connector intentionally; verify all other pipelines complete successfully.

#### Tenant Data Isolation

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-nfr-ing-tenant-isolation`

Data from one workspace **MUST NOT** be accessible or mixed with data from another workspace. `tenant_id` **MUST** be present and correct in every Bronze and Silver record.

**Threshold**: Zero cross-workspace data leakage.

**Verification**: Query Bronze and Silver tables; verify no records exist with incorrect or missing `tenant_id`.

#### Observability

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-nfr-ing-observability`

Pipeline execution **SHOULD** provide visibility into: sync status, record counts, execution duration, error details, and dbt model status. Argo Workflows UI and Airbyte UI **SHOULD** serve as primary observability surfaces.

**Threshold**: All pipeline executions visible in Argo UI within 1 minute.

**Verification**: Trigger a pipeline; verify execution appears in Argo UI with status, duration, and task details.

### 6.2 NFR Exclusions

- ClickHouse cluster performance tuning (infrastructure concern)
- Network latency optimization to source APIs (external dependency)
- Airbyte platform high-availability configuration (infrastructure concern)

#### Airbyte API

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-interface-ing-airbyte-api`

Airbyte Public API for managing sources, destinations, connections, triggering syncs, and registering custom connectors.

### 7.2 External Integration Contracts

#### Airbyte Protocol

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-contract-ing-airbyte-protocol`

Airbyte Protocol v2 defines the message format between connectors and destinations: RECORD, STATE, LOG, TRACE, CONTROL, SPEC, CATALOG, CONNECTION_STATUS message types.

#### dbt Contracts

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-contract-ing-dbt-contracts`

dbt model contracts via `schema.yml`: column types, not-null constraints, accepted values, and relationships.

#### Airbyte REST API

**Main Flow**:

1. Author creates a connector directory in the monorepo: `src/ingestion/connectors/{connector_class}/{source_name}/`
2. Author writes a declarative manifest (`connector.yaml`) defining streams, authentication, pagination, and incremental sync
3. Author adds `tenant_id` injection via `AddFields` transformation in the manifest
4. Author writes dbt models in `src/ingestion/connectors/{connector_class}/{source_name}/dbt/` (e.g., `to_git.sql`, `to_collaboration.sql`) mapping Bronze fields to Silver schema
5. Author creates `descriptor.yaml` declaring package name, Silver targets, and stream definitions
6. Author tests locally using ultra-light debugging (source.sh) or Kind K8s cluster
7. Author registers the connector with Airbyte via `update-connectors.sh`
8. Platform engineer creates Airbyte connection via `update-connections.sh`

**Postconditions**:

### Use Case 2: Scheduled Ingestion Pipeline Run

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-usecase-ing-scheduled-run`

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-argo`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-airbyte`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-dbt`

**Preconditions**:

- Connector is registered in Airbyte
- Connection is configured via `update-connections.sh`
- CronWorkflow is applied via `update-workflows.sh`

**Main Flow**:

4. Author runs `source.sh read {connector} {connection}` to extract sample data
5. Author inspects JSON output for correctness (schema, `tenant_id` presence)
6. Optionally, author pipes output to a local destination for integration testing

**Postconditions**:

- Author has validated connector behavior without deploying to Airbyte

**Reference**: [Airbyte Connector DESIGN](../../connector/specs/DESIGN.md)

### Use Case 4: Add Data Source to Workspace

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-usecase-ing-add-source-to-workspace`

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-workspace-admin`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-platform-engineer`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-ing-toolbox`

**Preconditions**:

- Connector package exists
- Airbyte platform is running

**Main Flow**:

1. Workspace admin provides credentials in `connections/{tenant}.yaml`
2. Platform engineer runs `./update-connections.sh {tenant}` to create source + destination + connection in Airbyte
3. Platform engineer runs `./update-workflows.sh {tenant}` to create CronWorkflow in Argo
4. CronWorkflow picks up the new connection on next scheduled run

**Postconditions**:

- Data from the new source flows through the pipeline with the correct `tenant_id`

## 9. Acceptance Criteria

- A nocode connector package can be created, tested locally, registered with Airbyte, and produce data in Bronze and Silver tables
- A CDK connector package follows the same packaging and deployment workflow
- Argo Workflows successfully orchestrates the full extract-transform cycle (Airbyte sync -> dbt run)
- All Bronze and Silver records contain a valid `tenant_id`
- `update-connections.sh` can create and update Airbyte connections from tenant YAML configs
- Pipeline failures in one connector do not affect other connectors
- Incremental sync correctly resumes from the last cursor position
- Local debugging workflow (source.sh) works for nocode connectors without Airbyte platform

## 10. Dependencies


| Dependency                   | Type              | Description                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Airbyte                      | External platform | Connector execution, connection management, catalog discovery                                     |
| Argo Workflows               | External platform | Pipeline scheduling, DAG orchestration, retry, observability                                      |
| dbt-clickhouse               | External tool     | SQL transformation framework with ClickHouse adapter                                              |
| ClickHouse                   | External database | Bronze and Silver data storage                                                                    |
| Identity Resolution          | Internal domain   | Downstream consumer of Silver step 1 tables ([DESIGN](../../identity-resolution/specs/DESIGN.md)) |


## 11. Assumptions

- Airbyte's ClickHouse destination supports shard-local table writes and `ReplacingMergeTree` engine
- Argo Workflows is stable on Kind K8s for local development and managed K8s for production
- Declarative manifests can express all required authentication and pagination patterns for planned sources
- ClickHouse cluster is provisioned and accessible from the Kubernetes cluster

## 12. Risks


| Risk                                                 | Impact                                                 | Mitigation                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Airbyte ClickHouse destination limitations           | Cannot write to shard-local tables correctly           | Evaluate destination capabilities early; fork destination if needed      |
| Argo Workflows version incompatibility               | Pipeline orchestration unreliable                      | Pin Argo version in Helm values; test upgrades in local Kind first      |
| Declarative manifest limitations for complex sources | Must fall back to CDK for more connectors than planned | CDK path is fully supported; declarative is preferred, not exclusive     |
| `tenant_id` enforcement gaps                         | Data without `tenant_id` reaches Silver                | Automated validation in dbt tests (`not_null` on `tenant_id`)           |
| Connection config drift                              | Airbyte connections out of sync with YAML configs      | Re-run `update-connections.sh` on deploy; state persisted in K8s ConfigMaps |
