## Changelog

- **v1.2** (current): Four changes addressing PR #230 review comments.
  1. **Rollback is replaced by shadow-deploy.** The plugin system never mutates a live install in place. An upgrade installs the new version alongside the old one, both run for a tenant-configurable trial period against the same inputs, the admin inspects a comparison view, and either PROMOTES the shadow stack (old one is uninstalled; bronze retained) or REJECTS it (shadow stack is uninstalled; tenant returns to the unchanged live stack). Expired trials default to REJECT. There is no distinct rollback operation. New FR `cpt-plugin-fr-shadow-deploy-upgrade`; UC-003 rewritten to this model (addresses `cyberantonz` review comment).
  2. **Each plugin ships its own isolated transform project.** Plugins MUST NOT use dbt `ref()` across plugin boundaries; downstream plugins discover upstream outputs only through the schema-based input contract, and the runtime injects `sources.yml` at run time. No global dbt DAG spans plugins. New FR `cpt-plugin-fr-isolated-transform-project`. Aligns transformation mechanics with the independent-authorship goal already stated for packaging and versioning.
  3. **Dependency-graph UI elevated to p1/MUST.** Given non-auto-healing behavior (no legacy mode, no silent rollback) and the shadow-deploy workflow, tenant and instance admins cannot operate the plugin system without a graph view of live + shadow stacks and per-node health. `cpt-plugin-fr-dep-graph-ui` now MUST and p1, matching the acceptance criterion that already assumed it.
  4. **UC-004 preconditions fixed.** v1.1 refactored silver to schema-based input contracts but missed the UC-004 preconditions paragraph; it still said "silver declares a dependency on the connector plugin." Rewritten to match `cpt-plugin-fr-silver-input-contract`.
- **v1.1**: Clarified four points after product-team review.
  1. Connectors are responsible not only for fetching data but also for normalizing it into their declared output schema — bronze is what the connector declares, not the vendor's raw payload.
  2. Silver plugins are decoupled from their suppliers by design: a silver plugin declares the input schema it expects plus discovery rules (tags, patterns, or install-time parameters) for locating source tables, and does NOT declare plugin-level dependencies on connectors. Contract matching is schema-based; a new connector that produces the expected shape feeds existing silver without either side knowing about the other. `UNION ALL` across discovered sources is the recommended pattern but not a requirement.
  3. The platform does not validate widget input data on the wire — the host app is a data proxy. Widgets that want input validation ship their own data tests (dbt or equivalent); the plugin runtime executes them before render.
  4. Tenant upgrade sovereignty is explicit: the instance admin can set policy (catalog allowlists, block lists, force-uninstall a broken plugin) but **cannot** install or upgrade plugins for a tenant. Upgrade decisions stay with the tenant admin so that a bad upgrade is caught by the party responsible for the data.
- **v1.0**: Initial PRD. Established a unified plugin model with composable capabilities (`connector`, `silver`, `widget`), tenant-scoped installation, explicit admin-driven dependency resolution, and bronze-as-sacred data policy. Deferred manifest schema, native-protocol details, and authoring SDK to DESIGN/ADR and v2.

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

The Plugin System is the extension mechanism of the Insight platform. It enables first-party teams, enterprise customers, and third-party authors to add new data sources, transformations, and visualizations to a running Insight instance without rebuilding the product and without coordinating a release cycle with the vendor.

Every plugin is a self-contained artifact published to an OCI registry. A tenant admin installs it through the product UI, the instance runtime resolves its dependencies, and its behavior is bounded by well-defined capability contracts: `connector` (fetches from a source system and writes out a declared, normalized schema — its bronze), `silver` (discovers bronze tables matching a declared input contract and produces cross-source silver tables), and `widget` (renders part of the dashboard UI). A single plugin may declare any combination of these three capabilities.

### 1.2 Background / Problem Statement

Insight today ships with a fixed set of connectors, silver dbt models, and frontend widgets, all embedded in the product repository. Extending the system for a new source — GitLab, Jira, a bespoke internal system — requires a backend PR, frontend PR, dbt model updates, and a full release. A customer that wants to onboard a data source the vendor has not yet built cannot do so; an enterprise customer with internal tooling has no path to express its own metrics without forking the product.

Two additional pressures make the current model untenable. First, the ingestion substrate is transitioning from Airbyte to a native orchestration that gives the platform more control, and this transition should not require every connector to re-ship as a hand-written service. Second, the dashboarding surface is moving to a microfrontend model; the set of available widgets must expand at runtime, not at build time.

A plugin system decouples the vendor's release cadence from the customer's need to extend the product. It treats every new source, transform, and visualization as an installable unit with a declared contract, making the product extensible in the same way Airbyte makes source-system ingestion extensible, VS Code makes editor features extensible, or dbt packages make transformations extensible — but unified around a single artifact type so the contract across extension points is consistent.

**Target Users**:

- Tenant admins who need to onboard a data source or add a custom metric without vendor involvement
- Insight instance admins who set which plugins a tenant may install and manage the central catalog mirror
- Plugin authors (first-party, enterprise, third-party) who build and publish connectors, silver transformations, or widgets
- Downstream components (analytics-api, frontend, admin UI) that need a uniform way to discover and interact with installed extensions

**Key Problems Solved**:

- Customers can extend Insight with their own sources, transforms, and widgets without forking the product
- Vendor release cadence is decoupled from customer extension requests
- First-party and third-party extensions are subject to the same contract, so quality and support stories do not bifurcate
- The transition away from Airbyte does not require re-shipping every connector as product code
- Widgets extend the dashboarding surface at runtime rather than requiring a frontend rebuild

### 1.3 Goals (Business Outcomes)

**Success Criteria**:

- A tenant admin can install a first-party connector plugin end-to-end through the product UI in under 10 minutes (baseline: impossible today, requires vendor; target: self-service)
- A plugin author can ship a new version of an existing plugin to a customer without a product release (baseline: not supported; target: publish-to-registry + customer `install` is the full path)
- At least 3 distinct plugin authors (first-party, 1 enterprise customer, 1 third-party reference) have published working plugins against this contract before v1 is frozen (baseline: 0; target: 3)
- 100% of currently bundled ingestion connectors are expressible as plugins on this contract (baseline: all hard-coded in the repo; target: all refactored into the plugin model by end of rollout)
- Zero vendor releases required to add, upgrade, or remove a tenant's plugin set (baseline: required today; target: 0)

**Capabilities**:

- Publish a plugin to any OCI-compatible registry (Docker Hub, ghcr.io, a customer-owned registry)
- Discover available plugins through a central Insight catalog and through ad-hoc URL install
- Install, upgrade, and uninstall plugins per-tenant with explicit admin-driven dependency resolution
- Carry multiple versions of the same plugin within a single tenant when needed for migration
- Compose a plugin from one or more capabilities — `connector`, `silver`, `widget` — in a single artifact
- Coexist with the existing Airbyte-based ingestion substrate during the transition period
- Report per-plugin health, sync status, and dependency-graph state to instance admins

### 1.4 Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Plugin | A versioned, self-contained extension packaged as an OCI artifact with a declarative manifest. A plugin declares one or more capabilities (`connector`, `silver`, `widget`) and its own dependencies on other plugins and on the platform. |
| Plugin ID | A globally unique reverse-DNS identifier for a plugin (for example, `com.cyberfabric.git-gitlab`). Namespace-per-author disambiguates plugins that would otherwise collide by short name. |
| Plugin version | A SemVer string attached to each published plugin build. Version comparison, range expressions, and breaking-change semantics follow SemVer 2.0. |
| Capability | One of three declared behaviors a plugin may contribute: `connector` (emits bronze data from a source system), `silver` (transforms bronze into unified silver tables), `widget` (renders a UI element). One plugin may declare any combination. |
| Manifest | The machine-readable declaration inside a plugin that describes its identity, capabilities, dependencies, input/output data contracts, config schema, and required secrets. Exact schema is defined in DESIGN. |
| Central catalog | The Insight-operated registry of curated plugins, serving metadata (identity, versions, compatibility, description) that the instance UI uses to populate the marketplace. A plugin can also be installed by direct URL without appearing in the catalog. |
| Plugin install | A record in an Insight instance's database that says "tenant T has plugin P at version X installed and enabled (or disabled)." The installed image + manifest is cached locally; its reconciliation into runtime resources is performed by the plugin runtime. |
| Plugin runtime | The subsystem inside the Insight instance that reconciles installed plugins into runtime state — fetches images, runs migrations, schedules connectors, applies silver transforms, registers widgets, reports health. |
| Connector capability | A plugin capability that fetches data from an external system, normalizes it into its declared output schema, and writes it to the connector's per-install bronze scope. Normalization is the connector's responsibility — a downstream silver plugin expects the connector to have already shaped the data, not raw vendor payloads. The execution protocol may be Airbyte, a future native Insight protocol, or any other protocol the author wants, as long as the running container produces the declared bronze output. |
| Silver capability | A plugin capability that discovers bronze tables matching a declared input contract (schema + discovery rules — tags, name patterns, or install-time parameters) and produces silver tables with a unified cross-source schema. Silver plugins are decoupled from specific connectors by design: they match on the input contract, not on a connector's plugin identity. The recommended default is a `UNION ALL` across discovered sources followed by incremental consolidation, but plugins MAY skip that step and emit derived tables directly. Execution engine is author's choice — dbt is the reference. |
| Widget capability | A plugin capability that provides a runtime-loaded frontend component (microfrontend) for the dashboard surface. A widget declares the data shape it expects; the host application fetches data by reference and passes it to the widget through a stable interface **without validating its shape or content**. Widgets that want input validation ship their own data tests (dbt or equivalent) and the plugin runtime executes them before rendering. |
| Bronze data | The data a connector plugin writes to its per-install scope in the connector's declared output schema (not the vendor's raw payload — the connector is responsible for normalizing into its declared shape). Treated as sacred — never deleted or transformed in place by the plugin system; retained so silver and gold layers can always be rebuilt by re-running downstream plugins. |
| Dependency resolution | The admin-API-driven process of determining, for a requested install or upgrade, what other plugin versions must coexist. Resolution is explicit and admin-approved; there is no auto-upgrade, auto-resolve, or "legacy compatibility" mode. |
| Plugin capability contract | The set of declared inputs (tables, config, secrets) and outputs (tables, widget interface) a capability exposes. Consumers (other plugins, the host app) rely on this contract; authors may add non-breaking fields within a major version. |

## 2. Actors

### 2.1 Human Actors

#### Plugin Author

**ID**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-author`

**Role**: Builds, packages, and publishes plugins. May be a first-party Insight engineer shipping a bundled plugin, an enterprise customer's internal team building a plugin for their tenant, or a third-party publishing to the marketplace. Owns the plugin's manifest, image, tests, and backward compatibility commitments across versions.

**Needs**: A clear, stable contract for each capability; a reference plugin to copy; a published manifest schema; a path to test against a local Insight instance before publish; the ability to iterate without vendor gatekeeping for non-catalog plugins.

#### Instance Admin

**ID**: `cpt-plugin-actor-instance-admin`

**Role**: Operates an Insight instance. Holds an **oversight** role over the plugin surface — not a gatekeeping one. Instance admins **can** (when they choose to) set catalog allowlists/blocklists, force-uninstall a broken or unsafe plugin, and restrict which plugins their tenants may install; this is optional, not required, and the default instance policy allows tenants to self-serve. Instance admins **cannot** install, upgrade, or reconfigure plugins on a tenant's behalf — every change that touches tenant data is initiated by the tenant admin so that the party responsible for the data is the one who approves each change. Owns the instance's overall plugin inventory visibility and the external secret store configuration.

**Needs**: Visibility into every installed plugin across tenants with health and version; the ability to block or force-uninstall a specific plugin when safety requires; a dependency graph view showing conflicts and reachability; an audit log of who installed or upgraded what.

#### Tenant Admin

**ID**: `cpt-plugin-actor-tenant-admin`

**Role**: Installs, configures, and removes plugins for their tenant. Picks from the instance-approved catalog or supplies a URL for an ad-hoc plugin. Configures each plugin install (credentials, workspace IDs, sync schedules) through the product UI.

**Needs**: A marketplace UI listing installable plugins with description and compatibility; a configuration form generated from the plugin's declared config schema; per-plugin status (last sync, error count); an uninstall path that does not orphan bronze data without warning.

### 2.2 System Actors

#### Plugin Runtime

**ID**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-runtime`

**Role**: Reconciles the installed-plugin inventory into running state inside the instance. Pulls plugin images from the configured OCI registry, runs the plugin's migrations, schedules connector syncs, applies silver transforms, registers widgets with the frontend, and writes health telemetry back to the inventory.

#### Admin API

**ID**: `cpt-plugin-actor-admin-api`

**Role**: Exposes CRUD on plugin installs, invokes the dependency resolver, talks to the OCI registry to fetch manifests for resolution, and serves the marketplace UI and admin dashboards.

#### Central Catalog

**ID**: `cpt-plugin-actor-central-catalog`

**Role**: Insight-operated service that maintains curated plugin metadata (identity, versions, descriptions, compatibility ranges). Read-only from the instance's perspective. Instance admins mirror or filter it into their local marketplace; tenant admins do not query it directly.

#### OCI Registry

**ID**: `cpt-plugin-actor-oci-registry`

**Role**: Any OCI-compliant container registry (Docker Hub, ghcr.io, customer-owned). Stores plugin images and manifests. Plugin runtime pulls from here during install and upgrade. Air-gapped instances are expected to mirror images into a customer-owned registry.

## 3. Operational Concept & Environment

### 3.1 Module-Specific Environment Constraints

- Every plugin install must be able to reach the OCI registry it was installed from, OR the instance must mirror the image into a reachable registry during install. Air-gapped deployments require the latter.
- Plugin containers run in the same Kubernetes cluster as the Insight instance; cluster resource quotas apply per install.
- Plugin capabilities that write to the shared data store (`connector`, `silver`) require the platform to provide them with a scoped, per-install credential — they do not use the tenant's own DB credentials.
- Widget capability requires the host frontend to support the microfrontend loader that is being adopted for the product; until that lands, widget capability ships as `p2` (see FRs below).

## 4. Scope

### 4.1 In Scope

- Plugin artifact model — identity, versioning, manifest, OCI packaging, reverse-DNS naming, SemVer semantics
- The three capabilities — `connector`, `silver`, `widget` — and the contract each exposes to consumers
- Single-artifact multi-capability plugins (one plugin may mix `connector` + `silver` + `widget` contributions)
- Distribution — central Insight catalog + ad-hoc URL install; any OCI-compatible registry
- Installation lifecycle — install, upgrade, uninstall, disable, enable at tenant scope
- Dependency resolution — explicit, admin-driven, per-tenant, supporting multiple versions of the same plugin simultaneously
- Per-install configuration via a plugin-declared config schema; UI renders form from it
- Per-install secret storage via an external secret manager plus a manual-entry fallback
- Observability — per-plugin health, sync status, dependency-graph state surfaced to instance admin
- Transition-period coexistence with Airbyte — the connector capability can use the Airbyte protocol for connectors that already implement it and reuse the Airbyte destination to write bronze
- Bronze data preservation across plugin upgrades and version switches (bronze is sacred; silver/widget configs are re-derivable)

### 4.2 Out of Scope

- Plugin authoring SDK / CLI (`insight-plugin init|validate|test|package|publish`) — deferred to v2; v1 ships docs + reference plugins
- Automatic dependency resolution or auto-upgrade — every resolution is explicit and admin-approved
- "Legacy" compatibility mode — a plugin cannot be upgraded if its transitive dependencies cannot also be upgraded; the admin decides whether to proceed or stay on the old version
- Plugin sandboxing beyond standard Kubernetes container isolation (network policy, resource quota, serviceaccount scoping) — stronger sandboxing (gVisor, WASM) is a follow-up PRD
- Rollback of silver and widget data — these layers are re-derivable from bronze; plugin system does not snapshot them. Connectors MAY ship migrations for bronze-schema changes but are not required to
- Cross-tenant plugin sharing — each tenant install is independent; future federation is not in v1
- Exact manifest schema, exact database schema for the installed-plugin inventory, and the API/protocol shape for native-Insight (non-Airbyte) connectors — these are DESIGN-level and tracked in Open Questions
- Soft-delete / GDPR erasure tooling for plugin-produced data — inherited from platform-wide data lifecycle (separate PRD)
- Billing, metering, or marketplace payment flow — out of scope for v1 plugin system; any commercial model is a later program

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Packaging and Distribution

#### Plugins Ship as OCI Artifacts

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-oci-artifact`

Every plugin **MUST** be published as an OCI artifact (container image plus manifest metadata) to an OCI-compatible registry. The plugin system **MUST** accept plugins from Docker Hub, ghcr.io, and any registry that speaks the OCI distribution spec, including customer-owned private registries.

**Rationale**: Uniform packaging across first-party, enterprise, and third-party plugins; leverages an already-deployed ecosystem; supports air-gapped installations through registry mirroring.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-author`, `cpt-plugin-actor-oci-registry`

#### Reverse-DNS Naming and SemVer Versioning

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-naming-versioning`

Every plugin **MUST** be identified by a reverse-DNS identifier (`com.acme.git-gitlab`) that is globally unique across authors. Every published build **MUST** carry a SemVer 2.0 version. The plugin system **MUST** reject installs whose ID collides with an already-installed plugin from a different author.

**Rationale**: Reverse-DNS avoids short-name collisions between independent authors (two different `git` plugins). SemVer gives dependency resolution a principled ordering and a clear breaking-change signal.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-author`, `cpt-plugin-actor-admin-api`

#### Central Catalog and URL Install Coexist

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-catalog-and-url`

The plugin system **MUST** support two install sources: a curated central catalog (metadata served by the Insight-operated catalog service) and ad-hoc URL install (tenant admin supplies an OCI reference for a plugin that is not in the catalog). Instance admins **SHOULD** be able to restrict their tenants to catalog-only plugins via an instance-level policy.

**Rationale**: Central catalog enables discovery, curation, and compatibility testing for the common case. URL install enables customer-authored plugins that are never intended to be published publicly without requiring a catalog gatekeeping workflow.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-plugin-actor-instance-admin`, `cpt-plugin-actor-central-catalog`

#### Declarative Manifest Per Plugin

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-manifest`

Every plugin **MUST** ship a machine-readable manifest that declares at minimum: reverse-DNS identity, version, human-readable name, description, author/license, supported platform version range, the capabilities it contributes (`connector`, `silver`, `widget`, or any composition), for each capability its data contract (inputs, outputs), config schema, required secrets, and the plugin's dependencies on other plugins. The manifest schema itself is defined in DESIGN.

**Rationale**: The manifest is the contract that dependency resolution, UI form generation, catalog display, and health reporting all depend on. Without a declared manifest, the platform cannot install a plugin safely.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-author`, `cpt-plugin-actor-admin-api`

### 5.2 Installation and Dependency Resolution

#### Tenant-Scoped Installs

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-tenant-scoped-installs`

Every plugin install **MUST** be scoped to a single tenant. Two tenants in the same instance installing the same plugin **MUST** get independent installs — independent config, independent bronze scope, independent schedule. Instance admins **MAY** restrict the set of plugins available to tenants through allowlists or through catalog filtering.

**Rationale**: Tenants are the atomic billing / isolation boundary; shared installs would break tenant isolation and complicate uninstall.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-plugin-actor-instance-admin`

#### Multiple Versions of the Same Plugin Coexist

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-multi-version`

The plugin system **MUST** support installing two or more versions of the same plugin within a single tenant concurrently. This is the mechanism for migration across breaking changes — the old version keeps producing bronze while the new version is validated, then the old version is uninstalled.

**Rationale**: Without multi-version support, every breaking upgrade is a cutover that risks data loss or downtime. With it, migrations become incremental.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-runtime`

#### Explicit, Admin-Driven Dependency Resolution

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-explicit-resolution`

When a tenant admin requests an install or upgrade, the admin API **MUST** compute the full set of plugins (and versions) that would need to be added or upgraded to satisfy the request and **MUST** present that set to the tenant admin for approval before any change is applied. The tenant admin **MUST** be able to reject the resolution. The plugin system **MUST NOT** automatically upgrade, downgrade, or uninstall plugins on anyone's behalf.

**Rationale**: Plugins may touch tenant-critical data. Surprise upgrades are unacceptable. Explicit resolution gives the tenant admin a decision point and an audit trail; the default behavior of doing nothing unless approved is the safe default.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-plugin-actor-admin-api`

#### Tenant Upgrade Sovereignty

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-tenant-sovereignty`

The plugin system **MUST NOT** allow an instance admin to install, upgrade, reconfigure, or enable a plugin on behalf of a tenant. Instance admins retain oversight powers — catalog allowlists, force-uninstall, and blocking specific plugins — but every change that adds to or advances a tenant's plugin set **MUST** be initiated and approved by a tenant admin. Emergency force-uninstall by an instance admin **MUST** be recorded in the audit log with the reason and **MUST** notify the tenant admin.

**Rationale**: If a plugin upgrade corrupts tenant data, the party who approved the upgrade must be the one responsible for the data — otherwise accountability breaks down. The instance admin's job is to protect the instance (block dangerous plugins, contain outages); it is not to push changes into tenants who have not asked for them.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-plugin-actor-instance-admin`

#### Shadow-Deploy Upgrade with Trial Period

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-shadow-deploy-upgrade`

When a tenant admin approves an upgrade plan, the plugin runtime **MUST** install the new plugin version (and any newly-required dependency versions) as a SHADOW STACK alongside the existing install rather than replacing it in place. Both stacks **MUST** run concurrently for a tenant-configurable TRIAL PERIOD (default: 7 days; minimum: one natural sync period or 24 hours, whichever is shorter). During the trial the plugin system **MUST**:

- Keep the existing live stack as the authoritative data producer for user-facing surfaces (widgets, analytics-api) — no user observes the upgrade until it is promoted.
- Run the shadow stack against the same inputs, writing to its own per-install scopes (`bronze_<shadow_install_id>`, `silver_<shadow_install_id>`, and so on for any capability the plugin introduces).
- Expose a comparison view in the admin UI with row counts, schema diffs, and — where shapes match between old and new — per-column distributional statistics, so the tenant admin can inspect the change before committing to it.

At the end of the trial the tenant admin either PROMOTES the shadow stack (the runtime uninstalls the old version plus any transitive dependencies that become unused, the shadow stack becomes live, and the old bronze is retained per `cpt-plugin-fr-bronze-preserved`) or REJECTS it (the runtime uninstalls the shadow stack; shadow bronze is discarded because no downstream consumer relied on it; the tenant returns to the unchanged live stack). If the trial period expires without explicit action, the runtime **MUST** default to REJECT — plugins **MUST NOT** silently promote themselves.

The plugin system **MUST NOT** expose a distinct "rollback" operation. Reverting a live plugin to a prior version is accomplished by initiating a new shadow-deploy whose target is the older version (still published in the catalog under `cpt-plugin-fr-semver-contracts`): the same trial, comparison, and promote/reject loop applies.

**Rationale**: In-place upgrades that roll back on failure require the system to snapshot live state and restore it transactionally across connector + silver + widget — expensive to implement, hard to test, and the rollback path is almost never exercised until an incident. Shadow-deploy inverts the risk: the new version proves itself on real data before anything flips for users. It naturally composes with multi-version coexistence (`cpt-plugin-fr-multi-version`) and the bronze-is-sacred guarantee (`cpt-plugin-fr-bronze-preserved`) — during the trial both stacks write to their own scopes without interfering. It also replaces the vague "rollback" concept with a symmetric, well-understood primitive.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-runtime`

#### No Legacy Compatibility Mode

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-no-legacy-mode`

When a dependency cannot be satisfied (for example, plugin A at v2 requires plugin B at ≥3.0.0 but plugin B is pinned at 2.x for another plugin), the plugin system **MUST** refuse the install and surface the conflict to the admin. The plugin system **MUST NOT** attempt to run plugin A in a fallback mode against an older plugin B.

**Rationale**: Implicit "best-effort" compatibility layers compound indefinitely and create dependency-hell states that are impossible to reason about. Forcing an explicit choice keeps the dependency graph honest.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-admin-api`, `cpt-plugin-actor-tenant-admin`

#### Inventory in Instance Database

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-inventory-storage`

The plugin system **MUST** persist the per-tenant installed-plugin inventory (which plugin IDs, at which versions, enabled or disabled, when installed, by whom) in the instance database. The inventory **MUST** survive restarts, `helm upgrade` of the Insight umbrella, and reconciliation by the plugin runtime.

**Rationale**: The inventory is the source of truth about a tenant's extension surface. Storing it in the instance DB (not in Kubernetes CRDs) keeps it co-located with tenant data, enables transactional admin-API operations, and simplifies backup.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-admin-api`, `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-runtime`

#### Unused-Dependency Reporting

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-unused-reporting`

The plugin system **SHOULD** identify plugin installs that were pulled in as transitive dependencies and are no longer referenced by any user-installed plugin, and **SHOULD** present them to the admin for optional uninstall. The system **MUST NOT** uninstall them automatically.

**Rationale**: Prevents dependency cruft from accumulating silently as plugins come and go. Keeps the surface area the admin has to reason about aligned with current reality.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-instance-admin`

### 5.3 Connector Capability

#### Connector Normalizes Source Data to a Declared Output Schema

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-connector-output-contract`

A plugin that declares the `connector` capability **MUST** declare its output as a schema (tables + columns + types) in its manifest and **MUST** guarantee that every row it writes to bronze conforms to that declared schema. The connector **MUST** perform whatever reshaping is required to normalize raw source payloads into the declared shape (pivoting, renaming, type coercion, de-nesting, timestamp normalization, etc.) — it is the connector's responsibility, not the downstream silver plugin's, to absorb the vendor's data quirks.

**Rationale**: Decoupling silver from vendor idiosyncrasies is the architectural intent. If every silver plugin had to parse every connector's raw output, adding a new connector would require changing every silver plugin that consumes it. Pushing normalization into the connector means silver plugins match on shape alone and a new source becomes a drop-in.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-author`, `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-runtime`

#### Connector Writes to a Per-Install Bronze Scope

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-connector-bronze-scope`

A connector capability **MUST** write into a per-install bronze scope in the data store, isolated from every other connector install (including other installs of the same plugin for the same tenant at different versions). Tables, schemas, and any other data-store namespace the connector uses **MUST** be derivable from the `(tenant_id, plugin_id, plugin_version, install_id)` tuple so scopes do not collide.

**Rationale**: Bronze is the durable record of what the connector produced after normalization. Isolating scopes by install means uninstalls are safe (delete the scope), migrations between versions are safe (write to a new scope, validate, then switch), and multi-version coexistence works.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-runtime`

#### Bronze Data Is Preserved Across Upgrades

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-bronze-preserved`

The plugin system **MUST** preserve a connector install's bronze data across plugin upgrades unless the admin explicitly requests its deletion. Connector plugins **MAY** ship forward-only migrations for bronze schema evolution; silver and widget layers are always re-derivable and **MUST NOT** require any such migration.

**Rationale**: Bronze is the only layer not reconstructible from other layers. Losing it means losing history. Keeping it sacred is the single most important data-durability commitment of the plugin system.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-runtime`

#### Connector Execution Protocol Is Author's Choice

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-connector-protocol-flexibility`

A connector-capability plugin **MAY** be executed using any protocol its author chooses, as long as the running container produces bronze tables in its declared per-install scope. The plugin system **MUST** support the Airbyte source protocol (so that existing Airbyte connectors can be wrapped as Insight plugins with minimal rework) and **MUST** be extensible to other protocols — for example, Singer tap, or a future native Insight connector protocol — as they are adopted.

**Rationale**: Requires zero migration cost for the existing Airbyte connector fleet and avoids locking Insight into a single execution contract for the next decade. The platform's job is to give the connector a scope to write to and collect its output; how it produces that output is a plugin-internal concern.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-author`, `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-runtime`

#### Airbyte Connectors Reuse the Airbyte Destination for Bronze

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-airbyte-destination-reuse`

For connector plugins that use the Airbyte source protocol, the plugin system **MUST** support using the existing Airbyte ClickHouse destination to write bronze, rather than reimplementing the destination inside the plugin runtime.

**Rationale**: The Airbyte destination is battle-tested for the types and quirks of ClickHouse ingestion. Reimplementing it for v1 is busywork and a regression risk.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-runtime`

### 5.4 Silver Capability

#### Silver Declares an Input Contract, Not Supplier Plugins

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-silver-input-contract`

A plugin that declares the `silver` capability **MUST** declare its inputs as a contract consisting of (a) the expected schema (tables, columns, types) of each input and (b) discovery rules (tags, name patterns, or install-time parameters) by which the plugin runtime locates source tables in the data store. The silver plugin **MUST NOT** declare plugin-level dependencies on specific connector plugins for its data sources — compatibility is schema-based, not plugin-identity-based.

**Rationale**: Decoupling silver from specific connectors is the point of the capability boundary. A tenant that adds a third connector (say `git-bitbucket`) producing the expected shape should feed the existing `silver-git` plugin without `silver-git` being aware of it. A connector that upgrades to a new major version without changing the output schema should not trigger a silver-plugin upgrade. Schema-level contracts give this flexibility; plugin-ID dependencies would not.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-author`, `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-runtime`

#### Silver Produces Declared Output Tables

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-silver-transform`

A silver-capability plugin **MUST** declare its output silver tables (schema + columns + types) in its manifest and **MUST** produce them in a per-install silver scope. The recommended default processing pattern is `UNION ALL` across all discovered input sources with incremental consolidation, but the plugin **MAY** skip that step and emit pre-aggregated or derived tables directly; the choice is internal to the plugin.

**Rationale**: A silver plugin is in essence a function `(discovered bronze) → silver*`. Declaring the output explicitly is what allows widgets and other downstream consumers to rely on it. Leaving the internal pipeline shape to the plugin author lets complex cases (algorithmic enrichment, cross-entity joins, ML scoring) fit the same contract as simple union-based silvers.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-author`, `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-runtime`

#### Transformation Engine Is Author's Choice

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-silver-engine-flexibility`

Silver capability **MUST NOT** constrain the plugin to a specific transformation engine. dbt is the reference engine for the first-party silver plugins; authors **MAY** use Rust, Python, or any other language, provided the container reads the declared bronze inputs and writes the declared silver outputs.

**Rationale**: dbt's model is great for declarative SQL transforms but breaks down for algorithmic enrichment (identity resolution, ML scoring, custom aggregations). Forcing every silver plugin into dbt would either lock those cases out or contort them. Letting authors pick the engine keeps the capability broad.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-author`

#### Silver Consumer Validates Its Inputs

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-silver-consumer-validates`

A silver plugin **MAY** ship data-quality tests against its declared bronze inputs (dbt tests for dbt-based plugins; equivalent mechanism in the manifest for other engines). When such tests are present, the plugin runtime **MUST** execute them before running the transform and **MUST** report failures to the admin.

**Rationale**: Connectors evolve independently of silver plugins. The only robust defense against "connector sent us garbage today" is for the silver consumer to declare its expectations and check them before transforming. Shifts responsibility for compatibility to the party best positioned to enforce it.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-author`, `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-runtime`

#### Each Plugin Ships Its Own Isolated Transform Project

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-isolated-transform-project`

A plugin that performs transformations (connector normalization, silver transform, or any future transform capability) **MUST** ship its transformation code as a SELF-CONTAINED project scoped to its plugin directory — its own `dbt_project.yml`, its own `packages.yml`, its own macros and models, or the equivalents of another engine. Plugins **MUST NOT** use dbt `ref()` (or the equivalent cross-project reference mechanism of another engine) to reach into another plugin's models. The only supported cross-plugin data flow is via ClickHouse tables materialized by an upstream plugin and referenced by a downstream plugin as dbt `source()` (or equivalent) through the schema-based input contract (`cpt-plugin-fr-silver-input-contract`).

The plugin runtime **MUST** render source definitions (e.g., `sources.yml` for dbt plugins) with the concrete schema names resolved from the discovery rules at run time, injecting them into the plugin's transform project before each run. A plugin **MUST NOT** hardcode schema names that assume a specific upstream plugin install, and the plugin system **MUST NOT** construct a global transform DAG spanning plugins; each install runs its own transform end-to-end, on its own schedule, in isolation.

**Rationale**: A shared transform DAG (such as a single repo-wide dbt project) couples every plugin to every other plugin at compile time — one plugin's rename or type change compiles-fails a completely different plugin owned by a different author. Project-per-plugin isolation is what enables independent authorship, independent versioning, independent release cadence, independent runtime upgrade (including shadow-deploy), and the eventual path to third-party plugins. The cost is losing dbt's ability to order transforms across plugins — but cross-plugin ordering belongs at the system scheduling layer (cron + discovery-based source resolution), not inside the transform engine.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-author`, `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-runtime`

### 5.5 Widget Capability

#### Widget Ships as a Microfrontend Module

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-widget-microfrontend`

A plugin that declares the `widget` capability **MUST** ship a microfrontend module that the Insight host frontend loads at runtime. The host frontend **MUST** fetch the module on demand — widgets are not bundled into the product build — and **MUST** render the module within the container-provided frame.

**Rationale**: Runtime-loaded widgets are the only way to extend the dashboard surface without a frontend rebuild. Microfrontend is the contract the rest of the frontend is already moving toward; reusing it here means widget-capability plugins do not need a separate runtime.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-runtime`

#### Widget Receives Data from the Host App

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-widget-data-contract`

A widget capability **MUST** declare its expected input data as a table schema (column names, types, nullability) and optional config (JSON schema). The host application **MUST** resolve the data based on the dashboard's widget-instance configuration, fetch it, and pass it to the widget through a stable interface. The widget **MUST NOT** query the data store directly. The host **MUST** act as a pass-through — it **MUST NOT** validate that the delivered data matches the widget's declared schema.

**Rationale**: Centralizing data fetching in the host prevents widget plugins from leaking data between tenants, bypassing isolation, or holding long-lived DB credentials. Keeping the host a pure proxy (no semantic validation) avoids accidentally coupling the host to every widget's evolving schema; validation, when needed, belongs to the party that cares — the widget plugin itself (see `cpt-plugin-fr-widget-input-tests`).

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-author`, `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-runtime`

#### Widget Input Validation Is Opt-In via Plugin-Shipped Tests

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-widget-input-tests`

A widget-capability plugin **MAY** ship data-quality tests (dbt or an equivalent mechanism declared in the manifest) against its declared input. When such tests are present, the plugin runtime **MUST** execute them before rendering the widget and **MUST** surface failures to the admin. When such tests are not present, the host renders whatever it fetched without checking it.

**Rationale**: Data-shape mismatches break widgets silently today. Letting widget authors declare and enforce their own expectations shifts responsibility to the party who feels the pain. Keeping tests opt-in avoids forcing every trivial widget to invent a test suite.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-author`, `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-runtime`

#### Widget Config Is Merged Across Scopes

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-widget-config-merge`

Widget configuration **MUST** be layered across scopes with narrower scopes overriding broader ones through deep merge: instance default (from the silver plugin that ships the widget wiring) → tenant → dashboard → widget-instance. The layering **MUST** be deterministic and **MUST** surface the effective merged config to admins for diagnostics.

**Rationale**: Real customers need per-tenant customization (branding, formatting) while keeping a sensible default. Deep merge lets admins change narrow slices of widget config without restating the whole thing at every layer.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-plugin-actor-instance-admin`

### 5.6 Tenant Isolation and Versioning

#### Per-Tenant Data Isolation

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-tenant-data-isolation`

All plugin-produced data **MUST** carry the `tenant_id` of the tenant it was produced for and **MUST** be queryable only within that tenant's scope. Cross-tenant reads from any plugin-produced table **MUST** be rejected by the data store's enforcement layer, not merely filtered by application code.

**Rationale**: Application-level filtering alone fails under bugs or malicious plugins. Enforcement at the data-store layer (row-level security policies or schema-per-tenant, as decided in DESIGN) is the only robust guarantee.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-runtime`

#### Plugin Versions Follow SemVer

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-semver-contracts`

Plugin authors **MUST** follow SemVer 2.0 — breaking changes to any declared capability contract (config schema, output tables, widget data contract) require a major-version bump. Additive changes **MAY** be minor versions; bug fixes **MAY** be patch versions. The plugin system's dependency resolver **MAY** use SemVer ranges in declared dependencies.

**Rationale**: Predictable version semantics are the foundation on which dependency resolution, upgrade approval, and author-to-consumer trust all sit. Without SemVer discipline, the graph is noise.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-author`

### 5.7 Configuration and Secrets

#### Config Schema Drives the Install UI

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-config-schema-ui`

Every plugin capability **MUST** declare its configuration requirements as a schema in its manifest. The admin UI **MUST** render a configuration form from that schema during install and configuration. The plugin system **MUST** validate submitted config against the schema before persisting it.

**Rationale**: Matches the tenant-UI install flow (Airbyte-like) without requiring custom UI per plugin. Validation at admin-API time catches misconfiguration early.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-plugin-actor-admin-api`

#### Secrets Supplied Through External Store or Manual Input

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-secret-provisioning`

Plugin capabilities that require secrets (API tokens, credentials) **MUST** declare them in the manifest. The plugin system **MUST** support providing them through (a) an external secret manager (configured at the instance level) and (b) a manual entry path in the admin UI for cases where no external store is wired up. Secrets **MUST NOT** be logged, leaked into manifests, or stored in the catalog.

**Rationale**: Enterprise customers expect secrets to flow through Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or an equivalent. Small deployments need a fallback that does not require that infrastructure. Both paths are common, and the split keeps each simple.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-plugin-actor-instance-admin`

### 5.8 Observability and Lifecycle

#### Plugins Report Operational Status

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-status-reporting`

Every installed plugin **MUST** report its operational status to the plugin runtime: connector sync progress and errors, silver transform run outcomes and data-test failures, widget render failures. The plugin system **MUST** make this status available to the instance admin through the admin UI.

**Rationale**: Without telemetry flowing back, "the dashboard is wrong" degenerates into a manual hunt across four systems. Centralizing status inside the plugin inventory gives admins a single pane of glass.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-runtime`, `cpt-plugin-actor-instance-admin`

#### Dependency Graph Surfaced to Admins

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-dep-graph-ui`

Instance admins **MUST** be able to view the dependency graph across all installed plugins with per-node health state (healthy, degraded, broken, upgrade available, in-shadow-trial). Tenant admins **MUST** see the subset of the graph relevant to their tenant, including any shadow-deploy trials currently in flight.

**Rationale**: Plugin ecosystems grow dense fast, and the system is explicitly non-auto-healing (no legacy mode, no silent rollback) — failures and conflicts must be investigated by a human. A visual graph is the only scalable way to find "what is broken and what does it block". For tenant admins during a shadow-deploy trial, seeing the live stack and the shadow stack side-by-side is part of the core upgrade workflow (`cpt-plugin-fr-shadow-deploy-upgrade`), not a nice-to-have.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-instance-admin`, `cpt-plugin-actor-tenant-admin`

#### End-User Error Surface Is Minimal

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-fr-end-user-error`

Non-admin users **MUST NOT** be exposed to plugin-internal error detail. When plugin state prevents a dashboard or widget from rendering accurately, end users **MUST** see a generic "data temporarily unavailable" indicator; plugin-level diagnostics are surfaced only to admins.

**Rationale**: End users cannot act on plugin stack traces. Showing them is both a security concern (leaks plugin internals) and a UX regression.

**Actors**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-runtime`

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1 NFR Inclusions

#### Install-to-Functional Time

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-nfr-install-latency`

From the moment a tenant admin approves an install through the admin UI to the moment the plugin is functional (first successful bronze write for connector; first successful transform for silver; widget available on the dashboard surface), the plugin system **MUST** complete the flow in under 10 minutes p95 for plugins up to 200 MB in image size on a standard instance.

**Threshold**: p95 ≤ 10 minutes, measured from install request to `status = ready`.

#### Per-Tenant Plugin Capacity

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-nfr-tenant-capacity`

An instance **MUST** support at least 50 plugin installs per tenant and at least 200 plugin installs total across all tenants without degradation of catalog or resolver performance beyond documented thresholds.

**Threshold**: 50 installs per tenant; 200 per instance; resolver completes in < 2 seconds p95 at this scale.

### 6.2 NFR Exclusions

- **Multi-region distribution** (OPS): Plugin system is co-located with the Insight instance it extends; multi-region replication is an instance-level concern, not a plugin-level one.
- **Offline support** (UX): The admin UI that drives plugin install is an online tool. Air-gapped installation uses a mirrored OCI registry; offline authoring is out of scope.

## 7. Public Library Interfaces

### 7.1 Public API Surface

#### Plugin Catalog API

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-interface-catalog-api`

**Type**: REST API (read-only for tenant admins; read/write for instance admins)

**Stability**: stable

**Description**: Lists plugins available for install (merged view of central catalog + instance-local overrides + URL-installable check). Exposes plugin identity, available versions, description, declared capabilities, and compatibility range. The exact endpoint shape, pagination, and response payload are specified in DESIGN.

**Breaking Change Policy**: Additive fields non-breaking. Removing or renaming fields is a major version bump with a two-minor-release deprecation window.

#### Plugin Install API

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-interface-install-api`

**Type**: REST API (tenant admin + instance admin)

**Stability**: stable

**Description**: CRUD on installed plugins: request install, approve a resolved plan, upgrade, downgrade, enable, disable, uninstall. Every mutation produces an auditable event; every install change is presented as a resolved plan first and only applied on explicit approval.

**Breaking Change Policy**: Same as catalog API.

#### Plugin Runtime Interface

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-interface-runtime`

**Type**: Internal interface between the admin API and the plugin runtime

**Stability**: unstable (v1); target stable by v2

**Description**: Describes how a requested install/upgrade/uninstall is reconciled into runtime state — fetching the image, running the capability entrypoints, registering widgets with the frontend, surfacing status. Shape is defined in DESIGN.

### 7.2 External Integration Contracts

#### OCI Registry Contract

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-contract-oci`

**Direction**: required from external registry

**Protocol/Format**: OCI distribution spec v1.

**Compatibility**: Any registry that speaks OCI v1 works. Private registries require a pull credential configured at the instance level.

#### Plugin Capability Contracts

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-plugin-contract-capabilities`

**Direction**: provided by platform, required of plugins

**Protocol/Format**: For each of `connector`, `silver`, `widget`, the set of declared inputs/outputs in the manifest is the contract. A plugin that does not honor its declared contract (emits wrong tables, demands unmet config, etc.) is considered broken and **MUST** be surfaced as such by the plugin runtime.

**Compatibility**: Additive capability-contract evolution is allowed within a major version. Breaking changes require a major bump and explicit admin-approved migration.

## 8. Use Cases

### UC-001 Tenant Admin Installs a Plugin from the Catalog

**ID**: `cpt-plugin-usecase-install-from-catalog`

**Actor**: `cpt-plugin-actor-tenant-admin`

**Preconditions**: The tenant has at least one admin; the instance has the central catalog configured; the target plugin is in the catalog and not blocked at the instance level.

**Main Flow**:

1. Admin opens the plugin marketplace in the product UI and selects a plugin
2. UI displays the plugin's description, declared capabilities, compatibility range, and required config
3. Admin clicks Install; the admin API invokes the resolver
4. Resolver returns a resolved plan (this plugin + any dependencies with versions)
5. UI shows the plan and asks the admin to approve
6. Admin approves; plugin runtime pulls the image(s), runs any bronze migrations, configures the install, and activates it
7. Admin is presented with a configuration form generated from the plugin's config schema
8. Admin supplies configuration and secrets; the plugin begins operating within its declared capability

**Postconditions**: The plugin is installed, enabled, configured, and reporting status to the inventory. No prior plugins were modified.

**Alternative Flows**:

- **Resolver finds a conflict**: The resolver surfaces the specific conflict (plugin X requires version Y of plugin Z, but plugin Z is pinned at another version); admin rejects the plan or asks the owner of the conflicting plugin to upgrade. No state changes.
- **Image pull fails**: The install is marked failed; no state is partially applied. Admin retries or escalates to instance admin.

### UC-002 Plugin Author Publishes a New Version

**ID**: `cpt-plugin-usecase-publish-new-version`

**Actor**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-author`

**Preconditions**: The author has write access to an OCI registry and an existing plugin at version N.

**Main Flow**:

1. Author bumps the version in the plugin manifest per SemVer rules
2. Author builds the image, runs local validation against the documented contract, and pushes it to the registry
3. If the plugin is in the central catalog, the author (or their team) updates the catalog entry with the new version
4. Existing tenant admins see the new version appear in the UI as "upgrade available"

**Postconditions**: The new version is discoverable. Existing installs at the prior version continue to operate unchanged until their admins explicitly upgrade.

**Alternative Flows**:

- **Breaking change**: Author bumps the major version. Tenant admins see the upgrade as "breaking — major bump" in the UI and must explicitly opt in; the resolver flags dependent plugins that would also need upgrading.

### UC-003 Admin Upgrades a Plugin and Resolves Dependencies

**ID**: `cpt-plugin-usecase-upgrade-with-deps`

**Actor**: `cpt-plugin-actor-tenant-admin`

**Preconditions**: A plugin install exists; a newer version is available that requires a new version of another plugin.

**Main Flow**:

1. Admin selects Upgrade on the plugin's tile
2. Resolver computes the transitive **shadow-deploy** plan (this plugin + dependencies) — the new versions are installed ALONGSIDE the existing ones, not in place of them (per `cpt-plugin-fr-shadow-deploy-upgrade`)
3. UI shows the plan — which plugins will install as shadow versions, the tenant-configurable trial window (default 7 days), and the side-by-side comparison surfaces that will become available once data starts flowing
4. Admin approves; plugin runtime installs the shadow stack in parallel with the existing live stack; both stacks write to their own per-install scopes and run on their own schedules
5. During the trial window, the live stack continues to feed user-facing surfaces; the shadow stack processes the same inputs into its own scopes; the admin UI exposes a comparison view (row counts, schema diffs, per-column statistics where shapes match)
6. The admin PROMOTES the shadow stack (explicitly, or automatically after the trial window IF the tenant opted in to auto-promote) — the runtime uninstalls the old version and any transitive dependencies that become unused, the shadow stack becomes live, and old bronze is retained per `cpt-plugin-fr-bronze-preserved`
7. Inventory is updated; the graph view reports green on the promoted stack

**Postconditions**: On promote — the new version is live; old bronze is retained. On reject — no change to the tenant's plugin set; shadow scopes are discarded (they have no downstream consumers).

**Alternative Flows**:

- **Admin rejects at step 3**: No changes applied. Plugin remains at the prior version; the "upgrade available" indicator persists.
- **One plugin in the shadow stack fails to install**: The runtime reports the failure; **the live stack is untouched**. Admin can retry, fix config, or abandon the shadow-deploy without affecting running data.
- **Admin REJECTS at step 6**: Runtime uninstalls the shadow stack and its unused transitive dependencies. The tenant returns to the unchanged live stack.
- **Trial window expires without explicit action**: Default policy is REJECT (runtime uninstalls the shadow stack). No plugin ever silently promotes itself.
- **Reverting a previously-promoted upgrade**: This is not a distinct "rollback" operation — the admin simply starts a new shadow-deploy targeting the prior version (which remains available in the catalog), and follows the same flow.

### UC-004 Silver Plugin Consumes Bronze from a Connector Plugin

**ID**: `cpt-plugin-usecase-silver-consumes-bronze`

**Actor**: `cpt-plugin-actor-plugin-runtime`

**Preconditions**: A connector plugin and a silver plugin are both installed in the same tenant; the connector's output bronze schema matches the silver plugin's declared input contract (per `cpt-plugin-fr-silver-input-contract`). There is **no** plugin-level dependency declared between them — the match is schema-based, so the same silver plugin accepts any connector whose output shape satisfies its input contract.

**Main Flow**:

1. Connector plugin completes a sync and writes updated bronze
2. Plugin runtime triggers the silver plugin, passing the declared bronze inputs
3. Silver plugin runs its data-quality tests against the bronze inputs (per `cpt-plugin-fr-silver-consumer-validates`)
4. Tests pass; silver plugin runs its transform and writes silver outputs
5. Runtime records success; downstream consumers (widgets, analytics-api) observe refreshed silver data

**Postconditions**: Silver data is current; bronze is unchanged; status is green.

**Alternative Flows**:

- **Data-quality test fails**: Transform is not run; the failure is surfaced to the admin (instance and tenant) with a pointer to the failing test and the offending input. No silver state is overwritten with bad data.
- **Bronze schema changed unexpectedly**: Silver plugin's declared input contract no longer matches; runtime refuses the run and surfaces the contract mismatch to the admin, who must either upgrade the silver plugin or downgrade the connector.

## 9. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A plugin with `connector` capability can be published to ghcr.io and installed in an Insight instance through the marketplace UI, end to end, with no code changes to the Insight product
- [ ] A silver plugin whose input discovery yields zero matching bronze tables in the tenant is installable but surfaces a "no sources discovered" warning to the admin; installing a second connector that produces the expected shape makes the silver plugin's transform run without modifying the silver plugin
- [ ] An instance admin cannot install or upgrade a plugin on a tenant's behalf through the admin API; force-uninstall is allowed and is audit-logged with the reason
- [ ] A plugin that combines `connector` + `silver` + `widget` in a single manifest installs as one artifact and each capability becomes operational independently
- [ ] Two versions of the same plugin can coexist in one tenant; uninstalling the older version does not affect the newer version's bronze data
- [ ] Uninstalling a plugin preserves its bronze data unless the admin explicitly opts in to deletion
- [ ] Upgrading a plugin to a new major version requires explicit admin approval of the full transitive upgrade plan
- [ ] Upgrading a plugin installs the new version as a shadow stack alongside the live version; both run concurrently against the same inputs; the live stack continues to feed widgets / analytics-api until the tenant admin promotes the shadow stack; rejecting the shadow stack returns the tenant to the unchanged live stack with no user-visible interruption
- [ ] A shadow-deploy trial window expires without admin action defaults to REJECT; the shadow stack is uninstalled and no auto-promotion occurs
- [ ] Reverting a previously-promoted upgrade is performed by initiating a new shadow-deploy back to the prior version — there is no distinct "rollback" API
- [ ] Each plugin's transform code (dbt project or equivalent) is self-contained in the plugin directory; attempting to use dbt `ref()` to reach across plugins fails at compile time; a downstream plugin discovers upstream outputs only through the schema-based input contract with runtime-injected `sources.yml`
- [ ] A connector plugin using the Airbyte source protocol can be installed without the plugin author reimplementing destination logic
- [ ] A widget plugin loads in the host frontend at runtime without a product rebuild
- [ ] When a silver plugin's data-quality tests fail, the transform does not run and an admin-visible failure is recorded
- [ ] An instance admin can view the dependency graph of all installed plugins across all tenants, with per-node health state
- [ ] Attempting to install a plugin whose manifest is invalid (missing required fields, malformed schema) fails at the admin-API layer with a clear error, before any runtime action
- [ ] All plugin-produced tables carry `tenant_id` and cross-tenant reads are rejected by the data-store enforcement layer

## 10. Dependencies

| Dependency | Description | Criticality |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| OCI-compatible registry | Hosts plugin artifacts. Must be reachable from the instance or mirrored for air-gapped installs | p1 |
| Instance database | Stores the installed-plugin inventory, config, and audit log | p1 |
| Plugin runtime subsystem | Reconciles inventory into runtime state (Kubernetes workloads, frontend widget registration) | p1 |
| Host frontend microfrontend loader | Required for widget capability; `widget` FRs ship when this is available | p2 |
| Ingestion orchestration (Argo Workflows today) | Schedules connector syncs and silver transforms; called by the plugin runtime | p1 |
| External secret manager (optional) | Provides plugin credentials when configured; manual-entry fallback otherwise | p2 |
| Central catalog service | Curates and serves public plugin metadata | p2 (URL install works without it) |

## 11. Assumptions

- Insight instances run on Kubernetes; plugin containers are scheduled as Kubernetes workloads by the plugin runtime.
- Tenants are the atomic isolation boundary; a plugin install never spans tenants in v1.
- The product's existing microfrontend technology becomes available on the timeline expected for widget capability to ship at `p1`.
- The platform's existing Argo Workflows deployment is the orchestrator used to execute connector syncs and silver transforms; plugins do not bring their own scheduler.
- SemVer discipline is realistic to enforce on first-party and enterprise plugins; third-party plugins in the catalog may be checked by Insight before acceptance.
- Bronze data volumes remain within single-cluster capacity for v1; cross-cluster plugin coordination is not required.

## 12. Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Plugin authors misuse SemVer, shipping breaking changes as minor versions | Silent downstream breakage across tenants | Central-catalog entries run compatibility checks before listing; URL-install carries an explicit "untrusted source" warning in the admin UI; consumer plugins ship data-quality tests as the last line of defense |
| Dependency graph explodes into conflict states admins cannot untangle | Plugins become effectively impossible to upgrade | No-legacy-mode plus explicit resolution forces the conflict to the surface; dependency-graph UI gives admins visibility; unused-dependency reporting keeps the graph from accumulating cruft |
| Connector plugins write garbage bronze — typo, API change, malicious plugin — and silver consumers can't tell | Silver / gold layers quietly corrupt | Silver consumers ship their own data-quality tests against declared input contracts; plugin system runs them pre-transform and halts on failure |
| OCI registry is the single point of failure for install and upgrade | Plugin system unavailable when registry is down | Air-gapped path supports mirroring; instance admins can cache plugin images locally; install is idempotent so retry is safe |
| Plugin runtime crash leaves an install in a half-applied state | Manual recovery required | Every install/upgrade plan is persisted before application; runtime is reconciliation-based, so restart resumes from persisted state |
| Widget plugin escapes its sandbox and accesses tenant data it should not | Tenant data leakage | Widget does not query the data store directly; host app resolves the query and passes only the narrowed result; Kubernetes network policies restrict plugin pods to their declared egress |
| Third-party plugin becomes unmaintained and no one upgrades it past a breaking platform version | Tenants stuck, cannot upgrade platform | Central catalog marks maintenance status; instance admins can block unmaintained plugins; customers relying on third-party plugins are recommended to fork-on-need |
| Cost / resource explosion from tenants installing many heavy connectors | Cluster resource exhaustion | Plugin installs inherit per-tenant resource quotas enforced at the Kubernetes level; instance admins can cap plugins per tenant |
| Bronze data retention and delete flows conflict with GDPR / compliance requirements | Regulatory exposure | Bronze-is-sacred is a plugin-system guarantee; GDPR erasure is handled by a platform-level data-lifecycle tool that can drop a tenant's bronze scope on lawful request — not part of this PRD |

## 13. Open Questions

| Question | Owner | Target Resolution |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| Plugin manifest schema — exact YAML shape, required vs optional fields, how capabilities are expressed, extension points for future capability kinds | Backend tech lead + Plugin Author lead | DESIGN / first ADR |
| Native Insight Connector Protocol — if and when we define a protocol beyond Airbyte wrapping; stdin/stdout JSONL vs gRPC vs OpenAPI endpoints; is the protocol necessary in v1 or is "container writes to its declared scope" enough | Ingestion tech lead | DESIGN / second ADR, post-v1 if possible |
| Per-tenant isolation mechanism — single table with `tenant_id` column and RLS policies, vs schema-per-install — which better suits on-prem distribution; current platform uses the former at the table level | Data tech lead | DESIGN |
| Installed-inventory data model — exact tables, status state machine, audit log shape, relationship between plugin install and its per-install bronze scope | Backend tech lead | DESIGN |
| Integration testing strategy — how does a plugin author test their plugin against a real customer data shape when the customer's source system is behind a firewall that Insight cannot reach; options include recorded/anonymized request traces shipped to the author, an opt-in customer-side trace-collection service operated by the Insight team, mock servers per connector type, or a combination | Plugin Author lead + Customer Success | DESIGN + customer-engagement policy; track separately from the data-model DESIGN |
| Plugin-authoring SDK / CLI — `insight-plugin init\|validate\|test\|package\|publish` — is it v1 ("can't ship without this") or v2 ("docs + reference plugins first, CLI when patterns stabilize"); the intent is the latter, but the threshold at which the CLI becomes a necessity should be articulated | Plugin Author lead | v2 planning; revisit after first three external plugins |
| Widget data-contract expressiveness — is "table schema with columns + config JSON schema" sufficient for the interesting widget cases, or does it need streaming, multi-query, or cross-entity access; depends on dashboard-configurator direction | Frontend tech lead | DESIGN, after first 3 widget plugins |
| Catalog governance — who approves a third-party plugin's inclusion in the central catalog, what compatibility tests run, how unmaintained plugins are retired; policy, not technical | Insight Product Team | Policy doc, before third-party publish path opens |
| Cross-tenant plugin sharing — an instance admin shipping a plugin-install across all tenants in one step (for a customer with many tenants in one instance); whether this is a v1 convenience or belongs in v2 | Insight Product Team | v2 planning |
| Plugin health → end-user surface — what exactly does "data temporarily unavailable" look like; is it per-widget or per-dashboard; does it communicate "connector X failed" vs "silver transform failed" to the user or only to the admin | Product design + Frontend | Coordinated design pass before first external plugin ships |
| Transition off Airbyte — at what point does the connector capability stop needing Airbyte source protocol support (when all connector plugins are native) and is removing that support a major-version bump of the plugin system | Ingestion tech lead | Roadmap item after native protocol stabilizes |
