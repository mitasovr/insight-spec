## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

The Zoom Connector extracts collaboration activity from Zoom into the Insight platform's Bronze layer so the organization can understand which meetings happened, who attended them, how long participants stayed, and how actively users communicated through Zoom messages. The connector covers meetings as the primary collaboration signal, message activity as the primary async signal, and Zoom users only as supporting identity and directory context.

The connector is designed around incremental collection. Newly discovered meetings are not sufficient on their own; each newly discovered meeting must trigger collection of meeting details and participant records so that downstream analytics can measure real participation rather than only high-level summaries. Message activity is also required, but it is collected through a separate user-scoped message flow and should only be linked directly to meetings when Zoom exposes a reliable meeting-level relationship.

### 1.2 Background / Problem Statement

Zoom is a common collaboration platform for organizations that rely on scheduled meetings, ad hoc calls, and team messaging. Insight needs Zoom activity alongside Microsoft 365, Slack, and other collaboration sources to produce a complete view of communication patterns across the organization.

The existing Zoom connector reference is summary-oriented and useful for schema exploration, but the business need for Insight is more specific: the platform must know which meetings actually occurred, who participated in them, and how long each participant attended. Daily summary metrics alone are insufficient for this purpose because they do not provide durable per-meeting attendance evidence or participant-level duration.

Message activity is also required, but message content is not. The connector should support counts and activity attribution needed for collaboration analytics without turning Zoom into a content archiving system. Historical backfill is useful when available, but because source retention and account configuration may limit what can be recovered, backfill should be treated as best-effort while ongoing incremental collection remains mandatory.

**Target Users**:

- Platform operators who configure Zoom credentials, scopes, and collection schedules
- Data analysts who consume Zoom meeting and message activity in Silver and Gold layers
- Organization leaders who use participation and communication metrics to understand collaboration load

**Key Problems Solved**:

- Lack of per-meeting evidence showing which Zoom meetings occurred and who actually attended them
- Inability to measure participant attendance duration from summary-only datasets
- Missing Zoom message activity needed to compare synchronous and asynchronous collaboration behavior
- Risk of losing newly available meeting detail if discovery is not followed by immediate incremental enrichment
- Ambiguity about whether Zoom message metrics must always be tied to per-meeting enrichment even when the source exposes them more reliably through separate activity flows

### 1.3 Goals (Business Outcomes)

**Success Criteria**:

- Newly discovered Zoom meetings are enriched with meeting details and participant data within 24 hours of discovery (Baseline: no Zoom connector; Target: v1.0)
- Participant-level attendance duration is available for collected meetings that expose participant detail through the configured Zoom account (Baseline: unavailable; Target: v1.0)
- Per-user Zoom message activity counts are available for analyst use within 24 hours of source availability (Baseline: unavailable; Target: v1.0)

**Capabilities**:

- Discover Zoom meetings and enrich each newly discovered meeting with detail and participants
- Measure who attended a meeting and how long each participant attended
- Collect Zoom message activity for user-level communication metrics without storing message content, using a separate user-scoped message collection flow
- Support identity resolution through Zoom user directory data and stable source-native identifiers

### 1.4 Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Zoom Meeting | A Zoom-hosted meeting session used as the primary synchronous collaboration object for this connector scope. |
| Meeting Discovery | The process of identifying a meeting that has occurred or become newly visible to the connector. |
| Meeting Enrichment | Follow-up collection for a discovered meeting, including meeting detail and participant records. |
| Participant Attendance Duration | The amount of time an identified participant was present in a specific meeting, derived from source-provided attendance detail. |
| Message Activity | Zoom chat or messaging events and counts attributed to users; excludes message body content in this PRD. |
| User-Scoped Message Flow | A collection path that iterates over known Zoom users and collects their message activity independently from meeting enrichment. |
| Historical Backfill | Best-effort retrieval of older Zoom activity that may still be available from the source at the time the connector is first configured. |

## 2. Actors

### 2.1 Human Actors

#### Platform Operator

**ID**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-operator`

**Role**: Configures Zoom application credentials, enables required scopes, selects collection settings, and monitors run health.
**Needs**: A connector that can continuously collect Zoom activity without manual intervention and clearly signal when source limitations or failures threaten data completeness.

#### Data Analyst

**ID**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-analyst`

**Role**: Uses Zoom meeting attendance and message activity data in Silver and Gold models for reporting, trend analysis, and cross-platform comparisons.
**Needs**: Reliable meeting-level and participant-level activity with enough identity context to join Zoom data to other collaboration sources.

#### Organization Leader

**ID**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-business-lead`

**Role**: Reviews collaboration metrics to understand meeting load, participation levels, and communication patterns across teams.
**Needs**: Trustworthy metrics about which meetings happened, who attended, how long they attended, and how actively people used Zoom messaging.

### 2.2 System Actors

#### Zoom API

**ID**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-api`

**Role**: External API provider for Zoom meetings, participants, users, and message-related activity. Enforces authentication, entitlement, retention, and rate limits.

#### Bronze Ingestion Platform

**ID**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-bronze-ingestion`

**Role**: Receives Zoom connector output, persists Bronze records, and exposes them for downstream identity resolution and analytics processing.

## 3. Operational Concept & Environment

### 3.1 Module-Specific Environment Constraints

- Requires a Zoom account configuration and application scopes that allow meeting discovery, participant access, user lookup, and message activity collection
- Meeting discovery and participant collection require Zoom Dashboard API endpoints (`/metrics/meetings`), which are available only on Business, Education, or Enterprise plans; Pro-plan accounts do not have access to these endpoints
- The connector operates as a batch collector, not a real-time event stream
- The connector MUST run frequently enough to preserve newly available meeting and message activity before source-side retention or visibility limits reduce completeness
- Historical backfill is best-effort and depends on source retention, account permissions, and endpoint availability at onboarding time

## 4. Scope

### 4.1 In Scope

- Discovery of Zoom meetings that occurred within the configured collection window
- Incremental enrichment of every newly discovered meeting with meeting details and participant records
- Participant-level attendance data sufficient to determine who attended and how long they attended
- Collection of Zoom message activity for all messages in supported Zoom messaging surfaces through a separate user-scoped message collection flow
- Collection of Zoom user records only as identity and directory support for meetings and messages
- Connector run logging, completeness monitoring, and idempotent reprocessing of overlapping collection windows

### 4.2 Out of Scope

- Zoom Phone and non-meeting telephony activity
- Webinar collection and webinar analytics in this release
- Message content storage, transcript storage, file attachment ingestion, or compliance archiving
- Recording media, captions, whiteboards, and other rich meeting artifacts
- Silver and Gold transformation logic outside the Bronze connector boundary
- Zoom as a source-of-truth employee directory beyond identity support needs

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Meeting Discovery and Enrichment

#### Discover Zoom Meetings

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-zoom-meeting-discovery`

The connector **MUST** discover Zoom meetings that become newly visible within the configured collection window and persist source-native meeting identifiers, timestamps, organizer context, and meeting classification attributes required for downstream analysis.

**Rationale**: Insight cannot measure collaboration load from Zoom unless it has durable evidence of which meetings actually occurred.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-api`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-analyst`

#### Enrich Every Newly Discovered Meeting

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-zoom-meeting-enrichment`

For every newly discovered meeting, the connector **MUST** trigger incremental collection of meeting details and participant records within the same logical collection cycle or the next eligible follow-up cycle.

**Rationale**: Meeting discovery without immediate enrichment creates a risk that detailed evidence will be missing even when the meeting itself is known to have happened.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-api`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-operator`

#### Capture Meeting Participant Attendance

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-zoom-meeting-participants`

The connector **MUST** capture participant-level attendance for collected meetings, including enough source evidence to determine which participants attended each meeting and how long each participant attended.

**Rationale**: Participant attendance duration is a core business requirement for collaboration analysis and must not be reduced to user-day summary counts.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-api`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-analyst`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-business-lead`

#### Preserve Meeting-Level Traceability

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-zoom-meeting-traceability`

The connector **MUST** preserve stable meeting-level identifiers and relationships between meeting records and participant records, and it **SHOULD** preserve reliable links to related message activity when the source exposes such linkage.

**Rationale**: Downstream trust depends on the ability to explain how attendance and communication metrics were derived from source events.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-analyst`

### 5.2 Chat and Message Activity

#### Collect Zoom Message Activity

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-zoom-message-activity`

The connector **MUST** collect Zoom message activity for all supported messages in scope, attributing each message to a user and preserving the message-level metadata required to count user message volume over time.

**Rationale**: Insight needs Zoom async collaboration data to compare message behavior with meetings and with other collaboration platforms.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-api`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-analyst`

#### Use Separate Message Collection Flow

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-zoom-message-collection-strategy`

The connector **MUST** collect required Zoom message activity through a separate user-scoped message collection flow rather than through meeting enrichment.

**Rationale**: Message activity is mandatory, but it is implemented as its own async collection path so meeting enrichment remains meeting-scoped and message collection remains operationally independent.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-api`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-operator`

#### Do Not Force Meeting-Level Message Linkage

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-zoom-message-linkage-scope`

The connector **MUST NOT** require message activity to be collected through per-meeting enrichment unless the source provides a reliable meeting-level linkage. When such linkage is unavailable, the connector **MUST** collect message activity through the separate user-scoped activity flow and preserve the strongest available attribution context.

**Rationale**: Some Zoom message metrics may be available without trustworthy meeting-level linkage. Forcing them into meeting enrichment would create avoidable gaps or misleading associations.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-api`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-analyst`

#### Exclude Message Content

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-zoom-message-content-exclusion`

The connector **MUST NOT** store Zoom message body content when satisfying message activity requirements. The connector **MUST** limit collected message data to metadata and activity signals needed for counting, attribution, timing, and traceability.

**Rationale**: The business requirement is activity analytics, not content archiving. Avoiding message content reduces privacy exposure and keeps the connector aligned with Insight's collaboration-metrics use case.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-operator`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-business-lead`

### 5.3 Connector Operations and Data Integrity

#### Support Incremental Collection

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-zoom-incremental-collection`

The connector **MUST** support incremental collection so that ongoing runs process newly available meetings and message activity without requiring full historical reloads, using meeting-scoped enrichment plus a separate user-scoped message flow.

**Known limitation**: The current manifest implements stateful incremental sync only for meetings. Message activity uses a request-bounded window (`start_date` to `now`) without Airbyte state tracking, which effectively reprocesses the full configured window on every run. This is acceptable for v1.0 but should be revisited for large tenants.

**Rationale**: Incremental collection is required for sustainable operation and for timely enrichment of new Zoom activity.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-operator`

#### Support Best-Effort Historical Backfill

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-zoom-historical-backfill`

The connector **SHOULD** support best-effort historical backfill during onboarding or recovery scenarios, limited by source retention, permissions, and endpoint availability at the time of collection.

**Rationale**: Older activity is valuable when available, but the business requirement prioritizes ongoing completeness over guaranteed deep history reconstruction.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-operator`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-analyst`

#### Record Collection Runs

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-zoom-collection-runs`

The connector **MUST** expose enough operational metadata to detect failed or incomplete collection runs, whether through connector-emitted records or the surrounding ingestion platform runtime.

**Rationale**: Operators need enough visibility to detect failed or incomplete runs before data quality issues spread downstream.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-operator`

#### Prevent Duplicate Activity Records

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-zoom-idempotence`

The connector **MUST** be idempotent across overlapping collection windows so that repeated or recovery runs do not create duplicate meeting, participant, user, or message activity records for the same source event.

**Rationale**: Incremental connectors commonly reprocess recent windows. Duplicate creation would corrupt meeting counts, attendance metrics, and message counts.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-operator`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-analyst`

### 5.4 Identity and Directory Support

#### Provide User Identity Support

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-zoom-user-identity-support`

The connector **MUST** collect Zoom user identity attributes required to associate meetings, participants, and message activity with source users and to support downstream identity resolution.

**Rationale**: Meeting and message analytics lose business value if activity cannot be attributed to real people or matched across systems.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-api`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-bronze-ingestion`

#### Limit User Collection to Support Needs

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-zoom-user-directory-scope`

The connector **MUST** limit Zoom user collection to attributes needed for activity attribution, identity resolution, and operational support, and **MUST NOT** position Zoom user data as a standalone workforce directory product.

**Rationale**: Zoom users are in scope only to support collaboration analytics, not to expand the connector into an HR or directory system.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-operator`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-bronze-ingestion`

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1 NFR Inclusions

#### Freshness

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-nfr-zoom-freshness`

The connector **MUST** make newly collected meeting and message activity available to downstream consumers within 24 hours of source visibility under normal operating conditions.

**Rationale**: Collaboration analytics lose value when Zoom activity arrives too late for reporting and operational review.

#### Completeness of Enrichment

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-nfr-zoom-enrichment-completeness`

The connector **MUST** achieve meeting enrichment for newly discovered meetings, where completeness means the meeting has corresponding detail and participant data or an explicit source-side explanation for why a component is unavailable.

**Rationale**: The primary business requirement depends on full per-meeting evidence, not just partial discovery.

#### Operational Resilience

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-nfr-zoom-operational-resilience`

The connector **MUST** tolerate retried runs, transient API failures, and overlapping recovery windows without producing inconsistent activity counts.

**Rationale**: External API variability is expected, but it must not undermine trust in the collected metrics.

### 6.2 NFR Exclusions

- **Real-time streaming latency**: Not applicable because this connector is defined as a batch collector rather than an event-streaming integration.
- **Message content retention and discovery**: Not applicable because message content is explicitly out of scope for this release.
- **Webinar-specific completeness targets**: Not applicable because webinar collection is explicitly deferred to a later release.

## 7. Public Library Interfaces

### 7.1 Public API Surface

None.

### 7.2 External Integration Contracts

#### Zoom Source Contract

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-contract-zoom-source-activity`

**Direction**: required from client

**Protocol/Format**: Zoom APIs with account configuration, permissions, and retention behavior sufficient for meeting, participant, user, and message activity collection

**Compatibility**: The connector depends on continued availability of the required Zoom activity surfaces; source-side entitlement or contract changes may reduce completeness until the connector is updated

**Implementation note**: See [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md) for connector manifest details including stream names, configuration parameters, and endpoint paths.

## 8. Use Cases

### UC-001 Collect Newly Discovered Meetings

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-usecase-zoom-collect-meetings`

**Actor**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-operator`

**Preconditions**:
- Zoom Server-to-Server OAuth credentials and required scopes are configured for meeting, participant, user, and message activity access
- A collection run starts for a window containing meetings not yet fully enriched

**Main Flow**:
1. The connector discovers newly visible Zoom meetings in the collection window
2. The connector records stable meeting identities and core meeting metadata
3. The connector persists meeting records with stable canonical meeting identity
4. The connector collects participant records for each newly discovered meeting
5. The connector does not require message activity to be attached to the meeting unless the source exposes reliable meeting-level linkage
6. The connector exposes enough operational evidence to detect success or failure and makes collected activity available for downstream processing

**Postconditions**:
- Each newly discovered meeting has corresponding detail and participant evidence
- Any meeting-linked message activity exposed by the source is preserved; otherwise message activity is collected through the separate user-scoped flow

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Participant detail unavailable**: If Zoom does not provide participant detail for a discovered meeting, the connector records the limitation in Bronze and through surrounding run observability rather than silently treating the meeting as fully evidenced
- **API failure during enrichment**: If enrichment fails for a subset of meetings, the run records the failure and leaves those meetings eligible for retry in a follow-up cycle

### UC-002 Collect Zoom Message Activity

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-usecase-zoom-collect-messages`

**Actor**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-zoom-analyst`

**Preconditions**:
- Zoom message activity is available through the configured account and scopes
- The connector runs for a collection window with eligible message activity

**Main Flow**:
1. The connector reads Zoom message activity through the configured separate user-scoped message collection flow
2. The connector attributes each message activity record to a source user
3. The connector persists message metadata needed for counting and timing analysis
4. The connector excludes message body content from persisted records
5. Downstream consumers aggregate message counts per user and time period

**Postconditions**:
- User-attributed Zoom message activity is available for analytics
- Message counts can be computed without storing message content

**Alternative Flows**:
- **No reliable meeting-level linkage**: If Zoom does not expose trustworthy meeting linkage for message activity, the connector preserves message activity without forcing a direct meeting association
- **Source limitations**: If a subset of message activity is not exposed by the source account, the connector records the limitation and proceeds with the supported message activity surfaces

## 9. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Insight can identify which Zoom meetings happened in the collection window and trace each collected meeting to a stable source meeting identifier
- [ ] Insight can determine who attended a collected Zoom meeting and how long each participant attended for the majority of eligible meetings
- [ ] Insight can compute per-user Zoom message counts without storing message content
- [ ] Newly discovered meetings trigger incremental enrichment for meeting detail and participants rather than remaining summary-only records
- [ ] Zoom message activity is collected through a separate user-scoped message collection flow without relying on meeting enrichment
- [ ] Historical Zoom activity can be backfilled on a best-effort basis without changing the requirement for ongoing incremental collection

## 10. Dependencies

| Dependency | Description | Criticality |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Zoom account and application access | Required Server-to-Server OAuth account configuration, credentials, and permissions for meeting, participant, user, and message activity collection | p1 |
| Zoom activity endpoint availability | Source support for exposing discoverable meetings, participant attendance detail, and message activity | p1 |
| Identity Manager | Resolves Zoom user attributes to canonical `person_id` for cross-source analytics | p1 |
| Bronze ingestion infrastructure | Persists connector outputs and provides operational visibility for downstream processing | p1 |
| Scheduler and monitoring | Executes recurring runs and surfaces collection failures or completeness regressions | p2 |

## 11. Assumptions

- Zoom Meetings are the only synchronous Zoom activity in scope for this release; Zoom Phone is excluded
- Webinar collection will be addressed in a later release and does not need to be represented as a meeting in this PRD
- Message activity refers to all supported Zoom messages in scope, but not to message body content
- Zoom message activity for the current connector implementation is collected only through a separate user-scoped message flow
- The current manifest stamps `tenant_id` into every emitted row from `insight_tenant_id`
- Message activity may not always have a reliable direct linkage to a specific meeting and should not be forced into meeting-scoped enrichment when such linkage is absent
- Source account configuration provides enough participant detail to calculate attendance duration for most eligible meetings
- The Zoom account is on a Business, Education, or Enterprise plan that provides access to the Dashboard API endpoints required for meeting and participant collection
- Deactivated Zoom users are excluded from the `users` stream (`status=active`); their historical meeting and participant records remain in Bronze but new message activity will not be collected
- Historical backfill depth varies by tenant and should be treated as best-effort rather than guaranteed
- Normalized user identity attributes such as email are available often enough to support downstream identity resolution

## 12. Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Zoom source limitations reduce participant visibility for some meetings | Attendance duration may be incomplete, weakening trust in collaboration metrics | Track completeness explicitly, record source-side limitations, and surface coverage gaps to operators |
| API fan-out for meeting enrichment is higher than expected | Large tenants may experience slower collection cycles or operational pressure during peak windows | Prioritize incremental collection, monitor enrichment completeness, and design scheduling around expected discovery volume |
| Dashboard API rate limits constrain participant collection throughput | The `/metrics/meetings/{uuid}/participants` endpoint is classified as heavy (20 req/sec); fan-out across thousands of meetings per run may cause throttling and extended collection times | Implement back-pressure, respect `Retry-After` headers, and consider batching collection across multiple shorter runs |
| Message activity coverage differs across Zoom plans or account configurations | Per-user message counts may be incomplete or inconsistent across tenants, and meeting-level linkage may not always be available | Treat message coverage as a source dependency for the separate message flow and expose linkage limitations through connector or platform observability |
| Historical activity is not fully recoverable during onboarding | Early dashboards may start with partial history and create baseline gaps | Set onboarding expectations that backfill is best-effort and prioritize stable ongoing collection from day one |
