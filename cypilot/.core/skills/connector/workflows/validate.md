# Validate Connector

Checks that a connector package meets all requirements from the connector spec.

## Step 1: Automated structural validation (MANDATORY)

Before the checklist review, always run the automated validators:

```bash
./src/ingestion/tools/declarative-connector/source.sh validate-strict <category>/<name>
./src/ingestion/tools/declarative-connector/source.sh validate        <category>/<name>
```

- `validate-strict` — runs the Airbyte Builder UI JSON-schema check (no `$ref` resolution). This is the definitive compat test for the Builder UI. Must exit 0.
- `validate` — runs the CDK loader check (resolves `$ref` first). Lenient; must also exit 0.

If either fails, fix the reported per-path errors before proceeding with the checklist. See `src/ingestion/tools/declarative-connector/README.md` §"Debugging strict-validation errors".

## Step 2: Builder-UI compatibility checklist (manifest-only)

If `validate-strict` passed, these are already satisfied automatically — but eyeball them when reviewing a PR to catch intent mistakes:

- [ ] No whole-object `$ref` to `#/definitions/<X>` or `#/streams/<N>`. Only leaf-field `$ref` into `#/definitions/linked/<Component>/<field>` is allowed.
- [ ] Every `AddFields.fields[]` item has `type: AddedFieldDefinition`.
- [ ] `OffsetIncrement.page_size` and `CursorPagination.page_size` are literal integers (not templates).
- [ ] `concurrency_level.default_concurrency` is a literal integer.
- [ ] Schema `$schema` is `http://json-schema.org/schema#` (not draft-07).
- [ ] Schema type arrays are `[type, "null"]`, not `["null", type]`.
- [ ] `check` block is present and placed BEFORE `definitions`.
- [ ] `version`, `type: DeclarativeSource`, `concurrency_level`, `metadata.autoImportSchema` present.
- [ ] Did NOT copy from `task-tracking/jira` (jira uses whole-object `$ref`; it is a known anti-template).

## Step 2b: Runtime-only pitfalls (checked by per-stream `read`, MANDATORY)

`validate-strict` does not catch these — only a live `read` against a real tenant does. Fail the connector review if any of these are present:

- [ ] `DatetimeBasedCursor` with `step` also has matching `cursor_granularity`. Missing `cursor_granularity` → CDK raises `ValueError: If step is defined, cursor_granularity should be as well`.
- [ ] No `format_datetime(...)` call inside an `AddedFieldDefinition.value` used as a cursor source. That Jinja expression may not render, leaving the literal template as the cursor value. Use native `%ms` / `%s` / `%s_as_float` / `%epoch_microseconds` in `cursor_datetime_formats` to parse epoch values directly from the source field.
- [ ] Every `record.get('X', {}).get('Y')` chain is replaced with `(record.get('X') or {}).get('Y')`. The `.get(key, default)` default only applies when the key is **missing**; it does NOT apply when the key is present with `null` value, and `None.get(...)` crashes the whole slice.
- [ ] Source API query syntax has been verified against a real tenant via `source.sh check`. YouTrack, Jira JQL, Salesforce SOQL each have distinct datetime and operator dialects — template substitution can produce syntactically valid but semantically wrong queries that `validate-strict` cannot detect.

## Step 2c: Per-stream `read` smoke test (MANDATORY)

Run the per-stream `read` loop from `connector-create.md` §5.6 and verify, for every stream:

- [ ] Record count > 0 (unless the source truly has no data).
- [ ] Error count = 0 (any `ERROR` / `FATAL` in the log is a blocker).
- [ ] Every emitted record contains `tenant_id`, `source_id`, `unique_key`.
- [ ] For incremental streams, a second consecutive `read` (without state reset) returns a strict subset of records — confirms the cursor is advancing.
- [ ] For substreams, parent-ids on child records resolve to records emitted by the parent stream.

## Step 3: Spec-level checklist

Read connector package files and verify each item:

### Structure
- [ ] `connector.yaml` exists (nocode) or `Dockerfile` + `source_<name>/source.py` exists (CDK)
- [ ] `descriptor.yaml` exists with required fields (name, version, type, schedule, workflow, dbt_select, connection.namespace)
- [ ] `README.md` exists with prerequisites, K8s Secret fields, streams table, and multi-instance example
- [ ] K8s Secret example in `secrets/connectors/<name>.yaml.example` with `insight_source_id` annotation
- [ ] `dbt/` directory with at least one .sql model and schema.yml

### Manifest (nocode)
- [ ] `version: 7.0.4` or compatible
- [ ] `type: DeclarativeSource`
- [ ] `spec.connection_specification` has `insight_tenant_id` as required
- [ ] `spec.connection_specification` has `insight_source_id` as required
- [ ] All config fields use prefixes (insight_*, azure_*, github_*, etc.)
- [ ] No bare `tenant_id` or `client_id` in config fields
- [ ] AddFields includes `tenant_id` from `config['insight_tenant_id']`
- [ ] AddFields includes `source_id` from `config['insight_source_id']`
- [ ] AddFields includes `unique_key` with pattern: `{tenant_id}-{source_id}-{natural_key}`
- [ ] InlineSchemaLoader has `additionalProperties: true`
- [ ] Schema includes `tenant_id`, `source_id`, `unique_key` as string fields
- [ ] Nullable types used only where API actually returns null (not all fields)

### CDK (Python)
- [ ] `parse_response()` injects `tenant_id`, `source_id`, `unique_key`
- [ ] `unique_key` includes `tenant_id` and `source_id`
- [ ] `spec.json` has `insight_tenant_id` and `insight_source_id` as required
- [ ] All config fields in `spec.json` use source-specific prefixes (`insight_*`, `github_*`, `jira_*`, etc.)
- [ ] No bare field names (`token`, `client_id`, `tenant_id`, `start_date`, etc.) in `connectionSpecification.properties`

### Descriptor
- [ ] `name` matches directory name
- [ ] `connection.namespace` = `bronze_<name>`
- [ ] `dbt_select` includes connector tag with `+` suffix (e.g., `tag:m365+`)
- [ ] `schedule` is valid cron expression
- [ ] `workflow` field is present
- [ ] No `streams` block (streams are owned by Airbyte connector, discovered via `airbyte discover`)
- [ ] No `silver_targets` block (Silver targets are determined by dbt model tags via `dbt_select`)

### dbt Models
- [ ] Model name follows `<connector>__<domain>.sql` pattern
- [ ] `materialized='incremental'`
- [ ] `schema='staging'`
- [ ] Tags include connector name and `silver:class_<domain>`
- [ ] SELECT includes `tenant_id`, `source_id`, `unique_key`
- [ ] Uses `{{ source('bronze_<name>', '<stream>') }}`
- [ ] Has `{% if is_incremental() %}` block

### dbt schema.yml
- [ ] Source defined with `schema: bronze_<name>`
- [ ] Model has `tenant_id` with not_null test
- [ ] Model has `source_id` with not_null test
- [ ] Model has `unique_key` with not_null and unique tests

### Credentials Template
- [ ] `credentials.yaml.example` lists all required fields
- [ ] `insight_source_id` is included
- [ ] No real credentials in any tracked file
